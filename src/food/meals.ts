/**
 * ## Meals
 *
 * My meals of `Meals.md`, each only its composition, one or more of my foods without grams, servings or variants,
 * since I prepare it a little differently every time. A meal goes into `Meals.md` from an entry, named in its search,
 * see `../day/meal.ts`; the food view lists my meals above my foods, where I change and remove them, and the search
 * of an entry finds them above my foods too, each with its short title in brackets, see {@link dishNameOf}.
 * - The line of a meal, wherever it stands, is that of every list of meals or foods, see `listLineOf` in `search.ts`:
 *   its name with its short title grey in brackets on one line, see {@link dishNameOf}, and what it gave the last time
 *   I ate it, a bare number under the head `My meals` and `kcal / meal`; for a meal never eaten what its foods give
 *   at the grams I logged each with last, see `dishesRead` in `reader/food.ts`.
 * - The section of the food view, built as that of my foods: `Meals`, then a search field, which shows only the meals
 *   whose name or foods hold what is typed, ignoring case and accents, see {@link dishesFound}, like `reis` finding
 *   every meal with rice; then the head and the line of each meal, the small grey `×` at its end, whose first click
 *   only asks, as the remove of the entry dialog does, the cross turning into the plain question mark,
 *   `Really remove?` as its tooltip. The plus beside `Meals` opens a field of a name, as the plus beside `Foods` its
 *   form, and a name typed in the search that no meal has offers `+ New meal “Linsen Curry”` last: either opens the new
 *   meal with the search of its foods, and its first food keeps it in `Meals.md`; its `×` drops it before.
 *   A click on a line opens the meal below it, its line staying as it was closed, its short title grey in brackets
 *   beside its name, though the name then stands twice: on top its name, which changes in place
 *   by a click into it, as that of a food, renaming it wherever it stands, also in every entry that holds it, see
 *   `dishRename` in `reader/food.ts`; then its short title, see {@link dishNameOf}; then its foods, each with
 *   its brand and store in brackets, its standard grams, which change in place, and its `×` while the meal has more
 *   than one, ordered by their standard grams by themselves, the most first, see `rankOf` in `reader/food.ts`, so
 *   the foods that matter most stand first; right after
 *   the name of the meal the small grey plus, like `Chili con Carne +`, which opens below its foods the search of my
 *   foods and of Open Food Facts by name or barcode, as the plus of a meal in an entry does, and closes it again;
 *   a food picked, a product taken into my foods first, changed for good in `Meals.md` at once, the search staying
 *   open and empty for the next, since I mostly add many, the cursor in it unless it stands in another field;
 *   a click on the line but on its plus closes the meal again.
 * - My meals load anew the moment a file of my new system changes, whoever changed it, like a food renamed in my
 *   foods below, see `../changes.ts`, but not while the cursor stands in their list, so nothing typed there is lost;
 *   so the section never shows, nor writes back, a meal as `Meals.md` held it before.
 *
 * - `./foods.ts`: Loads my meals, sends and removes meals, writes amounts and makes elements and buttons.
 * - `./search.ts`: The search of my foods and of Open Food Facts, which adds a food to a meal, and the head and lines
 *   of every list.
 * - `../search.ts`: Compares the text typed in the search of the meals with their names and foods.
 * - `../changes.ts`: Loads my meals anew the moment a file of my new system changes.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts the one plus and the one `×` into the buttons, and the plain question mark, their words
 *   as tooltip.
 * - `./meals.css`: Look of the section and of a meal opened.
