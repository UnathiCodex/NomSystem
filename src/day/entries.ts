 *
 * Sends new, changed, moved and removed entries of the log to the reader, the meal of a cooking, and the boxes
 * of the plan: new, changed and removed ones, a new one repeated weekly, a box logged at its real time or taken back,
 * pushed to the next day or dropped. A changed entry goes with its fingerprint as the dialog opened it, so the reader
 * refuses it once its file changed it since, and a moved one with its new times alone, so nothing the page holds
 * from before is written back.
 * After a change of the log the log of the shown day loads again, so the page shows what the files hold,
 * and with it the boxes, which are done once a log entry points to them, see `boxes.ts`;
 * after a change of a box alone, its sender loads the boxes again itself.
 *
 * The standard address of a name of `With` is made here, beside who I was with, see {@link standardAddressOf}.
 *
 * - `../search.ts`: Writes a name without accents for its standard address in `With`.
 * - `./series.ts`: The days of a series and the boxes it makes, for the type checker only.
 * - `fullcalendar`: Calendar that shows the log.
