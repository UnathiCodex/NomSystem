/**
 * ## Month
 *
 * Picks the day to show from a month, to jump far back or ahead much faster than day by day,
 * like to a birthday next spring to write down a gift idea for it, see `gifts.ts`:
 * a click on the date above plan and log opens the month of the shown day over the page, the shown day marked;
 * the arrows move by a month, the double arrows by a year, and a click on a day shows it and closes the month.
 * The month brings its dialog itself, `month.html`.
 *
 * - `fullcalendar`: Draws the month.
 * - `fullcalendar/daygrid`: Draws the month as a grid of its days.
 * - `fullcalendar/interaction`: Takes the click on a day.
 * - `fullcalendar/themes/forma`: Look of the month, coloured by `day.css` as the log is.
 * - `fullcalendar/locales/en-gb`: English names of days and months, the week starting on Monday.
 * - `./month.html?raw`: Html of the dialog of the month as text, packed into the built code by Vite.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Writes a date as a day in the form of the reader.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts the icons of the arrows into their buttons.
 * - `lucide`: The icons of the arrows.

/**
 * Opens the month of the first shown day, drawn anew each time, so the shown days are marked:
 * drawn only once the dialog shows, since FullCalendar measures its place, which a closed dialog does not have.
 * - `dialog`: The dialog of the month.
 * - `initialView`: A grid of the days of a month, always six weeks, so the dialog keeps its height.
 * - `aspectRatio`: Makes the grid 1.8 times as wide as high, so its days are small and wider than high.
 * - `headerToolbar`: None, since the month and its arrows stand above it, as above plan and log.
 * - `dayHeaderFormat`: Writes the days of the week short, like `Mon`.
 * - `dayCellClass`: Adds the class `month-day` to every day, which `month.css` makes clickable,
 *   `month-other` to the days of the months before and after, which it greys, and `month-shown` to the shown days,
 *   which it marks.
 * - `dayCellTopClass`, `dayCellTopInnerClass`: Add the classes `month-top` and `month-number` to the top of a day
 *   and to its number, which `month.css` puts into the middle in the size of the page.
 * - `dateClick`: Shows the clicked day and closes the month.
 * - `datesSet`: Writes the month above the grid, like `October 2026`.
 * - {@link HTMLDialogElement#showModal}: Shows the month over the page, `Esc` and a click beside it close it.
 *
 * @param shown - The shown days, the first first, like `2026-10-11`
 * @param pick - Shows a day, like `2026-10-23`
