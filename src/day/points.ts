/**
 * ## Points
 *
 * A list of points for the sections of the daily note, my gratitude and my points about the day: a small editor of
 * its own per section, the same as that of my files, see `../editor/editor.ts`, so a point is written here exactly as
 * there. Its text is the Markdown of the section, one `- ` line per point, shown as Obsidian's live preview shows it,
 * see `../editor/preview.ts`: each point a bullet, wrapping and growing with its text, its `- ` shown on the line of the
 * cursor. Its keys are those of the editor, see `../editor/keys.ts`: Enter starts the next point, on an empty one ends
 * the list; Shift+Enter goes on in the same point on a new line, a further line `  ⠀` under its text; Backspace right
 * after the `-` of a new, empty point makes it such a further line, and so on.
 * A list without points shows one empty point, `- `, so there is always a bullet to write at; a click beside the points
 * goes to the end of the last.
 * The reader writes the text into the note as it is, only keeping the points of the section points, see
 * `reader/note.ts`.
 *
 * - `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`: The editor, CodeMirror 6, as in `../editor/editor.ts`.
 * - `@codemirror/commands`: Undo, redo and the usual keys.
 * - `@codemirror/language`: Indents with tabs, as my notes do.
 * - `../editor/syntax.ts`, `../editor/keys.ts`, `../editor/preview.ts`: Markdown, keys and look of the editor.
 * - `../notes/notes.css`, `../editor/editor.css`: Look of the editor, as the class `editor-text markdown` of a list
 *   takes it, see `day.html`.
