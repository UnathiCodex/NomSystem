/**
 * ## Day
 *
 * Shows the log of a day as my one calendar, a time grid of one column, and beside it the plan of the day,
 * not as a calendar but as a calm list of boxes, see `boxes.ts`; above both the date of the day between its arrows,
 * with a small icon back to today on any other day;
 * at the right the trackers of the day, my sleep, my glasses of water and my food, and below them the daily note
 * with my gratitude and my points about the day at its top, which a phone shows in place of plan and log,
 * see {@link phoneShow}.
 * A click on the date opens a month to pick any day from, see `month.ts`.
 * A box goes into the log at its real time by dragging it there, or as expected with one tap on its ring.
 * The log is written by category: `+` below the time grid opens the entry by category for the last half hour,
 * a range selected in the time grid for that range, on a phone by a short press into the grid and pulling it down
 * over the time, as in Google Calendar, the range shown meanwhile as an entry with its start and end in front
 * of the others; a click on an entry changes it.
 * Entries are moved and resized by dragging, and the reader writes their new times alone into their files.
 * Entries look as Google Calendar shows them: what first, then the time, then the place, in one size, the time a light
 * grey, and a taller one its note below, see {@link entryContentOf};
 * a dish, a meal or a cooking, shows its summary, which leaves its drinks out. The kcal of a meal stay hidden
 * for a try; the dialog and the trackers show them. A glass of water does not show in the log at all, since the
 * counter of the trackers counts it.
 * The day opens on today's calendar date, which turns at 00:00, also after a reload, and while it shows today
 * it moves on with it; only a link to a day, like `/?date=2026-07-03` from the food view, opens on that day,
 * which the address then keeps no more, see `today.ts`.
 * The day loads anew the moment a file of my new system changes, whoever changed it, like a food renamed in the food
 * view in every entry that holds it, see `../changes.ts`, so it never shows what the files held before;
 * a change that comes while a dialog is open waits until it closes, see {@link dayAgain}.
 * The grid runs over the calendar day, from 00:00 to 24:00, and opens at 06:00; an entry past midnight shows on both
 * days, cut at midnight, like a sleep from 23:00 to 07:00 at the bottom of 12 October and at the top of 13 October,
 * see {@link dayStart}.
 *
 * - `fullcalendar`: Draws the calendar.
 * - `fullcalendar/timegrid`: Draws the time grid of the day.
 * - `fullcalendar/interaction`: Selects a time range, drags entries and takes boxes dropped from the list.
 * - `fullcalendar/themes/forma`: Look of the calendar, coloured by `variants.css`.
 * - `fullcalendar/locales/en-gb`: English names of days, months and buttons, the day before the month.
 * - `./note.ts`: Shows the daily note of a day, with its Markdown renderer; loaded with `import()` after the calendar,
 *   see {@link noteStart}.
 * - `./entries.ts`: Sends moved entries to the reader.
 * - `./categories.ts`: Writes the log by category, each field picked from its own list.
 * - `./boxes.ts`: Shows the boxes of the day beside the log, logs a box dropped into it, and makes what an entry is.
 * - `./evening.ts`: Writes my gratitude and my points about the day into its daily note, any time of the day;
 *   loaded like `./note.ts`.
 * - `./month.ts`: Picks the day to show from a month.
 * - `./gifts.ts`: Writes my gift ideas for the birthdays and holidays of the plan.
 * - `./search.ts`: Finds entries in my whole log and opens them on their day.
 * - `./places.ts`: Gives the name of the place of an entry, the part of its line before the first comma.
 * - `./trackers.ts`: Shows my sleep, my glasses of water, my food and my neck sessions of the day.
 * - `./times.ts`: Reads the typed times of the panels, writes the times of entries and the date of the day.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Writes a date as a day in the form of the reader.
 * - `../today.ts`: Gives today's calendar date and the day a link asks for, and moves the day on to the new day
 *   while it shows today.
 * - `../changes.ts`: Loads the day anew the moment a file of my new system changes.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts the icons of the arrows and of `+` into their buttons.
 * - `../timer.ts`: Shows the timer of a session running now in the bar of the day, `None` while none runs.
 * - `./swipe.ts`: Changes the shown day on a phone by a swipe sideways.
 * - `../phone.ts`: Tells a phone, which changes the day by a swipe.
 * - `lucide`: The icons of the arrows and plus.
 * - `./day.css`, `./search.css`, `./month.css`: Look of the day, one stylesheet per part.

/**
 * Content of an entry of the log, as Google Calendar shows one: what first in bold, see {@link whatOf}, then its time
 * in normal weight and the light grey of a time, then its place lighter still; a dish shows its summary, like
 * `Pizza Salami, Pizza Margherita`, never its drinks, which its summary leaves out.
 * Every entry shows its place by its label alone, its address hidden, a way its route, see `whereOf` in `places.ts`;
 * a place with a link opens it on a click, see `whereLinkedOf`.
 * What is never cut and the time never cut; only the place gives way where a line is too narrow,
 * cut with an ellipsis, see `log.css`.
 * The range being selected shows only its start and end,
 * like `15:00 – 16:00`, see {@link selectionIs}.
 * - An entry with room for one line, of a quarter hour or half an hour, see {@link linesOf}, shows what,
 *   then its start and end, then its place, parted by a middle dot with space on both sides, which `day.css` draws,
 *   never by commas, since names hold commas,
 *   like `Skill: IN0004_EinfuehrungRechnerarchitektur (VO) · 16:00 – 16:30 · 8120.01.101 (Audimax im Galileo)`;
 *   where an entry is narrower than what and its time, as on a phone, what stays whole and its time moves
 *   onto a next line, which the entry hides, and only what wider than the whole entry ends with an ellipsis.
 * - An entry with room for two lines, of 45 minutes, shows what on its first line and start and end on its second
 *   with its place after a dot, like `16:00 – 16:45 · 8120.01.101 (Audimax im Galileo)`, both lines centred
 *   in the entry, see `entry-inner-middle` in {@link dayStart}.
 * - An entry with room for three lines or more, from an hour, shows what, start and end and its place on lines
 *   of their own from its top, and below them its note, as many lines of it as are left, cut with an ellipsis;
 *   no place line when it has none, no note when it has none or no whole line is left.
 * On a phone an entry has a line more than on the computer from half an hour on, see {@link phoneLinesOf}, so what
 * a short one is goes on over its second line, and a place never ends in an ellipsis beside the time: with too little
 * room it moves whole onto the next line, shown where the entry has room for it, see `.entry-beside` in `log.css`.
 * Where what is wider than the entry, as on a phone, it takes a line more, broken where a word ends or, for a long name
 * like `IN0004_EinfuehrungRechnerarchitektur`, where its parts meet, see {@link breakableOf}; the lines below then
 * move down, and those the entry has no more room for stay hidden, see `.entry-lines` in `log.css`.
 * - `category`: Category of the entry, empty for an entry without one.
 * - `shownWhat`: What the entry was, a skill entry as its file writes it, like
 *   `IN0004_EinfuehrungRechnerarchitektur (VO)`, see `shownWhatOf` in `boxes.ts`.
 * - `what`: What the entry was, empty when it is its category, like an old `Sleep`
 *   written before it had its what.
 * - `from`: Where a way starts, its `X-FROM`, empty for none.
 * - `location`: Place of the entry, its `LOCATION`, like `Home Munich, Burgweg 1, 81375 München, Deutschland`.
 * - `place`: Place of the entry by its label, like `Home Munich`, for a way its route from its `X-FROM`,
 *   like `Home Munich -> TUM Garching`, see `whereOf` in `places.ts`, shown with its arrow drawn; empty when it has none.
 * - `link`: Link of the place, its `ALTREP`, like `https://nav.tum.de/room/8120.01.101`, empty for none.
 * - `note`: Note of the entry, its `DESCRIPTION`, empty when it has none.
 * - `start`, `end`: Start and end of the entry.
 * - `time`: Start and end, like `16:00 – 16:30`.
 * - `lines`: Lines the entry has room for, see {@link linesOf}.
 * - `whole`: What on its own lines, where its long names may break, see {@link breakableOf}.
 * - `shown`: The lines of the entry, which `.entry-lines` holds to the lines it has room for.
 * - `line`: The one line of an entry with room for one: what, its time and its place, in parts beside each other,
 *   see `.entry-line` in `log.css`.
 * - `timeLine`: The line with the time, alone or with its place beside it.
 * - `below`: The note below the lines shown, grey, its line clamp the lines left, see `.entry-note` in `log.css`.
 * - `content`: All lines, as high as the lines the entry has room for, so a line moved down by what taking two lines
 *   is hidden as a whole and never shows cut in half at the bottom of the entry; how many in `data-lines`,
 *   fitted to the part of the entry in sight once it is on the page, see {@link linesFit}.

 * another day, the icon back to today follows the new day; a day the page stays on when it becomes visible loads again,
 * see {@link dayAgain}.
 * While the grid scrolls, the lines of every entry fit to the part of it in sight, see {@link linesFit};
 * the calendar catches the scroll on its way down to the grid, `capture`, since it never rises.
 * - `initialView`: A time grid of the shown day, one column, the log.
 * - `headerToolbar`: None, since the date and its buttons stand above plan and log together, see {@link dayShow}.
 * - `dayHeaders`: Leaves out the name of the day above the column, which the date above says already.
 * - `allDaySlot`: Leaves out the row of the whole day above the grid, since no entry of my log lasts a whole day.
 * - `slotHeaderInnerClass`: Adds the class `slot-label` to the hour labels,
 *   so `log.css` sets their size and with it the height of the slots.
 * - `slotHeaderFormat`: Writes the hours in 24-hour form, like `14:00`; the entries write their times themselves.
 * - `eventContent`: Shows what an entry was, then its time and its place, see {@link entryContentOf}.
 * - `eventShortHeight`: Makes entries short that have no room for one line with the space above and below it,
 *   as high as 36 px in the grid or lower at the page's root size of 20 px: such a line needs 33 px, 0.3rem above,
 *   a line of 1.05rem and 0.3rem below, see `.entry-inner` in `log.css`, and the inside of an entry is 3 px lower
 *   than its place in the grid; so they show their one line without that space, like an entry of a quarter hour;
 *   one of half an hour, 41 px, is taller and shows its one line with it, see {@link entryContentOf}.
 * - `eventMinHeight`: Makes every entry at least as high as a quarter hour, 20 px, one line of an entry with its edge,
 *   so a shorter one, like ten minutes of my neck routine, still shows its line whole.
 * - `eventColor`: Edges the entries in the grey of the log from `variants.css`.
 * - `blockEventClass`: Adds the class `entry` to the entries,
 *   so `log.css` fills them in grey and only their edge keeps the grey of the log,
 *   and `entry-selection` to the range being selected, see {@link selectionIs}, which it fills in the calm grey
 *   of what is picked.
 * - `blockEventInnerClass`: Adds the class `entry-inner` to the inside of the entries,
 *   so `log.css` sets the size of their lines and cuts them at the edge of the entry instead of letting them stick out,
 *   and `entry-inner-short` to the inside of short ones, which takes away the space above and below their one line
 *   and keeps it 0.9rem high, and `entry-inner-middle` to the inside of those with room for one line or two,
 *   of half an hour to 45 minutes, on a phone for fewer than four lines with space, which centres their lines
 *   in the entry, see {@link middleIs}.
 * - `eventSources`: The log, see {@link logSourceOf}.
 * - `editable`: Lets entries be moved and resized, those that the reader marks `editable`.
 * - `snapDuration`: Moves, resizes and selects in steps of 15 minutes, while the grid keeps a line every 30 minutes.
 * - `eventDrop`, `eventResize`: Write a moved or resized entry back, see {@link entryDrag}.
 * - `dragScroll`: Turns FullCalendar's own scrolling at the edges off, which threw a scroll of the wheel back,
 *   see {@link edgeScrollStart}.
 * - `eventDragStart`, `eventDragStop`: Show the strips of the days before and after while an entry is dragged,
 *   and move an entry dropped on one of them, or on an arrow of the date, to that day, see {@link entryTurn};
 *   scroll the grid at its edges meanwhile, see {@link edgeScrollStart}.
 * - `eventResizeStart`, `eventResizeStop`: Scroll the grid at its edges while an entry is resized.
 * - `droppable`: Takes the boxes dragged from the list.
 * - `eventReceive`: Logs a box dropped into the log at the time of the drop, see `boxes.ts`.
 * - `eventsSet`: Tells the boxes the entries of the shown day, after every change.
 * - `eventSourceSuccess`: Loads the trackers again each time the log was read, see `trackersSee` in `trackers.ts`,
 *   and the timer of a session, so an entry saved, ended or removed shows there at once, see `timerSee` in `timer.ts`.
 * - `eventClick`: Opens the entry by category for an entry that can be changed, see {@link entryClick}.
 * - `selectMirror`: Draws the range being selected as an entry in front of the others, with its start and end,
 *   see {@link entryContentOf}; FullCalendar's own grey of a selection lies behind the entries, so a range over
 *   an entry, like an hour of food during a workshop, showed only in the free strip beside it.
 * - `select`: Opens the entry by category for a range selected in the time grid, and lets go of the range at once,
 *   so it never stays in the log as if it were an entry once the dialog is closed, also with `Esc`.
 * - `selectLongPressDelay`: Starts a selection on a phone after a short press of 300 ms, in place of FullCalendar's
 *   long press of a second, so a finger presses into the time grid and pulls the range down over the time,
 *   as in Google Calendar; a swipe moves at once, so it scrolls the grid, and once the grid scrolled FullCalendar
 *   selects nothing. An entry keeps the long press of a second before it is dragged, so a slow tap never moves it.
 * - `slotEventOverlap`: Lets an entry at the same time as a longer one lie over the right part of it, as in Google
 *   Calendar, on a computer and on a phone alike, so the longer one keeps its text at its left, like a workshop
 *   with `Food: Pizza Salami` during it.
 * - `nowIndicatorLineClass`, `nowIndicatorDotClass`: Add the classes `now-line` and `now-dot` to the line of now
 *   and its dot, so `log.css` draws them calm grey behind the entries, never through their text.
 * - `slotMinTime`, `slotMaxTime`: Run the grid over the calendar day, 00:00 to 24:00, as the trackers and the done
 *   boxes count it; an entry past midnight shows on both days, cut at midnight.
 * - `scrollTime`: Scrolls the grid to 06:00 at the start, for a day that does not hold now; today centres on now instead, see {@link nowCenter}.
 *
 * The theme keeps its own classes beside `slot-label`, `entry`, `entry-inner` and the others;
 * `log.css` wins because it comes after the theme's stylesheet.
