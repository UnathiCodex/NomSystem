/**
 * ## Meal in the entry by category
 *
 * A meal of the log, `Food`, in rows of the dialog, like every field, with the fewest steps and nothing nested:
 * - Summary: what I ate, written by itself, never typed: the meals, then the foods eaten beside them, parted by `, `,
 *   like `Chili con Carne, Weißbrot`, and after it in brackets what they give together, as a type stands after its
 *   skill, like `Chili con Carne, Weißbrot (660 kcal)`.
 * - Foods: what I ate, the one plus beside its name opening one list, a menu over the dialog right under the plus,
 *   see `listOf` in `choices.ts`, whose one search finds, as I type, my meals by their names and foods first, then my
 *   foods, then the products of Open Food Facts by name or barcode, see `../food/search.ts`; one click takes one:
 *   a meal brings its block, a row with its name, its kcal and a small grey `×`, which removes it, its foods indented
 *   below it; a food of mine its row; a product goes into `Foods.md` as Open Food Facts gives it and into the meal,
 *   no form in between. While the text typed is no meal of mine, the first row of my meals is the one plus with it,
 *   `+ New meal “Chili con Carne”`, which puts an empty block of a new meal of that name into the entry and opens its
 *   own search at once, see {@link mealNew}; its first food puts it into `Meals.md` as its composition, at once,
 *   saved or not, and every food added or removed changes it there, see {@link freshSend}. Last among my foods
 *   stands `+ New food “Linsensuppe”`, which opens the form of a food by hand named as typed; when nothing is found,
 *   like a barcode Open Food Facts does not know, one grey line says so. A food is a row with its name, its brand and store in brackets, its grams, its kcal
 *   and its `×`, which removes it, like a food I did not eat of a cooking.
 *   Its grams start at those I logged it with last in an entry of the same category, `Food` or `Cook`, see
 *   `gramsRead` in `reader/food.ts`, white like every fact, which I type over; the first time ever, they start empty,
 *   and I type my amount, like that of my chili; the cursor goes into the grams of what was picked, the first empty
 *   one first. An empty field counts nothing and is saved without grams; every amount is rounded and an estimate
 *   anyway, so none is marked as one. Enter in its grams opens the list again. A meal drawing from a cooking starts
 *   at the grams of the pot instead, see {@link drawnShow}.
 * A meal block has its own plus right after its name, which adds a food to it, from the same search without my meals;
 * Enter in the grams of one of its foods opens that search again, as Enter in those of a food beside the meals opens
 * the list of the row `Foods`.
 * The dialog writes each food as a line `X-FOOD`: its name, brand and store, then its grams, empty for none,
 * and for a food of one of my meals the meal after them, like `Hackfleisch;Gut & Günstig;Edeka;125;Chili con Carne`
 * or `Weißbrot;Harry;Rewe;50`, so the log keeps what the meal held that day, whatever I change in `Meals.md` later;
 * and the summary as its what, see {@link mealTitle}.
 * A meal whose summary names more than its foods, like `Bortzeit` written by hand, opens as that one meal with its
 * foods, so its name stays.
 * A cooking of the log, `Cook`, lists what went into the pot in the same rows, Summary and Foods,
 * each food with its grams, like `Hackfleisch;Gut & Günstig;Edeka;500;Chili con Carne`, and counts no kcal,
 * see `reader/food.ts`.
 * A meal may draw from one of my cookings of the days before it in a row of its own, see {@link cookedRowOf}:
 * its meals and foods come along, each food with its grams of the pot, which I type over with what I ate,
 * no total for the pot,
 * and the meal writes `X-COOKED` with the cooking's identifier and its foods with their grams as its own lines,
 * so meal and cooking each keep their foods, see {@link mealCooked}.
 * A meal eaten out, where nothing can be weighed, I log by photo through Claude, who writes its entry through the reader;
 * the dialog itself takes no photo.
