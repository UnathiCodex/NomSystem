/**
 * ## Trackers
 *
 * The trackers of the shown day, at the right of the bar of the day, as the reader counts them,
 * see `reader/trackers.ts`, calm and basic, side by side in one line, without descriptions under the pointer:
 * - Sleep: how long the night of the day lasted, the sleep I woke up from that morning, like `07h 30m`;
 *   its goal, the spread of my bedtime and the average of the week left out for now, since other things come first.
 * - Water: what I drank on the day in litres between `−` and `+`, like `1.5 l`, without a goal; `+` logs 0.25 l more,
 *   one glass of water, at the time of the tap on the shown day, `−` takes the last glass of water back;
 *   every other drink, like `Kaffee`, counts as one glass too. A day still to come takes no glasses.
 * - Food: the kcal of the day's meals, a total without goal, and in brackets after it the number of the meals,
 *   like `1,850 kcal (3 meals)`, so a meal missing shows, linking to the day in the food view.
 * - Neck: two tiles over the seven days up to the day: on how many of my study days I did
 *   a neck routine, short or long, like `2 / 5` over `short · study days`, a check from two thirds of them on,
 *   since about two thirds of the sessions already gave the large effects (Chen 2018), and on how many days a long
 *   one against my goal, like `1 / 3` over `long · 7 days`, a check once it is reached; a session is an entry `Body`
 *   of my neck routine, written by the entry by category, and a study day a day with an entry `Skill`;
 *   then my neck pain, rated 0 to 10 with each long session, the mean of my first four weeks against the last four,
 *   like `5.2 → 4.0` over `pain`, the outcome the routine is judged by.
 *   Hidden until I start my neck routine, see {@link neckShown}; its code stays.
 * A glass, 0.25 l, is a log entry `Drink` `Water` of five minutes, sent to the one writer of the log, see `entries.ts`;
 * the time grid shows glasses only as small marks, see `day.ts`. The card loads again whenever the log of the day changes.
 * The food view loads the trackers too, for the water of its day.
 *
 * - `./entries.ts`: Sends new and removed entries to the reader.
 * - `./times.ts`: Gives now on the shown day.
 * - `../food/foods.ts`: Writes amounts and makes elements.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Writes a date as a day in the form of the reader.
 * - `../today.ts`: Gives today's calendar date.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Makes the icons of the buttons.
 * - `lucide`: The icons glass, minus, plus and check.
 * - `fullcalendar`: Calendar that shows the day.
