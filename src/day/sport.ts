/**
 * ## Session of sport in the entry by category
 *
 * A session of the log, `Sport`, below its summary and place, built and working as a meal with its foods,
 * see `meal.ts`, in its look, see `meal.css`, on the computer as on a phone:
 * - Exercises: what I did, the one plus beside its name opening one list, a menu over the dialog, whose search finds
 *   my workouts first, then my exercises, then the basic ones of a gym, see `basicExercises` in `reader/sport.ts`,
 *   and a name typed that none has adds itself as a new exercise.
 *   Each variant of mine stands with its values grey beside its name, like `Dips 3 × 10` and `Dips 4 × 8 · 10 kg`,
 *   and brings them; one without values, a basic one or one typed new brings what I did of it the last time.
 *   A workout picked brings its block, as a meal brings its foods: a row with its name, the small grey plus after it,
 *   which adds an exercise to it, the kcal of its videos and a small grey `×`, which removes it with its parts;
 *   below it, indented under a thin grey line, its parts, each exercise with the values the workout holds for it,
 *   else with what I did of it the last time,
 *   each video with its minutes of `Videos.md`. An exercise picked alone stands by itself below the blocks.
 * - A row of an exercise, as that of a food: its name, then its sets, `×` and its repetitions, two small fields, and
 *   after them `reps`, a switch: a click turns it into `s` for an exercise on time, like a plank, and back, so
 *   `3 × 10 reps` and `2 × 60 s` stand alike; then its kilograms in place of the kcal of a food, empty for none,
 *   like for dips, and its `×`; the `×` between the fields and the units always show, so an empty row says what
 *   to type; a row of a video its title with its channel grey in brackets, its minutes in the field, its kcal
 *   and its `×`. On a phone the fields come first, as the grams of a food do, like `3 × 10 reps  Dips  kg`.
 *   A video comes only with a workout, which takes it in the sport area by its link, see `../sport/lists.ts`.
 * - Its time: while the session holds only videos, its end follows them as I change its parts, its start and their
 *   minutes, like `18:00` to `18:30` for two videos of 15 minutes, so a slot drawn too long in the log does not stay;
 *   with an exercise beside them it stays as I typed it, since only I know how long the exercises took.
 * No `With`, since I do sport alone, and no note, which the dialog hides for a session, see `categories.ts`.
 * The dialog writes each exercise as a line `X-EXERCISE`, its name, sets, repetitions and kilograms, then the workout
 * it belongs to, parted by `;`, like `Bench press;3;10;40;Push` or `Squat;3;8;50;` alone, and each video as a line
 * `X-VIDEO`, its title, channel, minutes, link and workout, so the log keeps what I did that day, whatever I change
 * in my workouts later, see `reader/sport.ts`; a session written before held its one workout as `X-WORKOUT`, which
 * its parts without a workout of their own belong to.
 *
 * - `./choices.ts`: Rows of the dialog and the lists that open as menus over it.
 * - `../sport/mine.ts`: Loads my workouts, exercises and videos, and what I did of each exercise the last time.
 * - `../food/foods.ts`: Writes amounts and makes elements and buttons.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts the one `×` into the button that takes a part back.
 * - `./sport.css`: What the rows of a session add to those of a meal.
