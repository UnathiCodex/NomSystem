/**
 * ## Search of the log
 *
 * Finds entries in my whole log, not only the shown day, like every `Talk` to add who was there with `With`:
 * a small button beside `Log +` opens the search, and what I type finds every entry that holds each typed word
 * in its summary, its category, its place, its people or its day,
 * as every search of the page compares, see `../search.ts`, like `Talk Sophale` or `Talk 10.2026`, never in its note. The results stand newest first,
 * each what it was, like `Talk: Artificial Intelligence`, and below it small and grey its day, its time, its place
 * and who I was with, like `Friday, 16.10.2026 · 13:45 – 14:15 · Mensa Leopoldstraße · Kicktipp`. A click on a result
 * shows its day and opens its dialog there; closing that dialog, saved or not, brings the search back with what I
 * typed, read anew, so I go from one result to the next. The search brings its dialog itself, `search.html`.
 *
 * - `./search.html?raw`: Html of the dialog of the search as text, packed into the built code by Vite.
 * - `./categories.ts`: Opens the dialog of an entry.
 * - `./boxes.ts`: Writes what an entry was as the log shows it, and builds the parts of a result.
 * - `./places.ts`: Gives the place of an entry by its label.
 * - `./times.ts`: Writes the times and the date of an entry.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Writes a date as a day in the form of the reader.
 * - `../search.ts`: Compares a typed text with an entry, alike everywhere.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts the icon of the search into its button, and makes its search field.
 * - `lucide`: The icon of the search.
