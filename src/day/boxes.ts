/**
 * ## Boxes
 *
 * The plan of the shown day as a calm list of boxes beside the log, which is my one calendar, see `reader/boxes.ts`:
 * its birthdays and holidays at the top, each looking like a box, with my gift idea for it beside it, when I have one,
 * see `gifts.ts`, then the boxes one after another like the stations of the day, as real as the log:
 * those with an expected time by their time, like my lectures, a cancelled one faded in its place, then those with
 * a deadline, then those without either, then tomorrow's suggested study sessions, dashed, see `suggestions.ts`,
 * and the cancelled boxes without time last; on today below them the boxes carried along, see below.
 * Every box has the same lines, open or done: its category in bold with a colon and what,
 * like `Skill: IN0004_EinfuehrungRechnerarchitektur (VO)`, as an entry of the log does, then grey its expected time,
 * its length only where no end shows it, with its place after them, by its label alone,
 * like `11:30 – 13:00 · Audimax im Galileo` or `01h 15m · Home Munich`, the place opening its link on a click when
 * it has one; then what it is about, each of its chapters and documents on a line of its own with a bullet,
 * by the last part of its path, like `02_LogisticPoissonRegression` and `04_LogisticPoissonRegression.pdf`, none
 * for a lecture, whose topic is not known before; a line without anything to say is left out.
 * No line counts the pushes or asks about them: a box goes on as often as I push it, and one I no longer want
 * I skip myself.
 * A box with a deadline shows from four days before it, see `reader/boxes.ts`, until it is done,
 * and on the day of its deadline always, done or not, and looks like every other box, its deadline in place
 * of its time and how near it is after its length, like `Deadline Fri, 23.10.2026, 12:00 · 02h 00m · in 3 days`;
 * it has no arrow, since it stays on the day of its deadline. Its sessions are dragged into the log, as many as it
 * needs, and leave it open; its ring ticks it submitted, which alone makes it done, see `reader/boxes.ts`.
 * An open box is dragged into the log at the real time: the reader writes a log entry like it, pointing to it,
 * as long as its expected duration, else half an hour, and I resize the entry when it lasted otherwise.
 * Every box shows its two buttons, not only under the pointer: done, the ring at its left, which logs it
 * as expected with one tap, from its expected time, else ending now, see `times.ts`, a box with a deadline ticks it
 * submitted, and `⋯` at its right, whose menu holds all else it can do, like skip,
 * see below; when the reader does not log a box dropped or tapped, a hint says so above the list until it loads again.
 * Everything undoes with one click: the check of a done box takes it back to open, removing its log entry
 * unless that holds what I added since, see `boxUndo` in `entries.ts`, and the arrow back of a skipped or pushed box.
 * A done box keeps exactly the lines it had open, only greyed with the check in its ring; its real time and length
 * the log shows. An open box is as bright on a day that is over as on today, so a day before looks like today.
 * An open box that can be changed is skipped, cancelled, with its cross, or pushed to the next day,
 * one whose day is over to tomorrow, with its arrow, both in the menu of its `⋯`; a skipped box stays in its file,
 * see `reader/boxes.ts`, and shows greyed, never struck through, at the end of the list, where its arrow
 * back takes it back.
 * A pushed box stays greyed on each day it left, once per push, with the start and the length it had there,
 * see `leftBoxesOf` in `reader/boxes.ts`, the arrow in its ring, which leads to the day it stands on now, as a click
 * on its lines does; the last of them has the arrow back, which takes that push back. Skipped, cancelled
 * by the university and pushed look and work alike, greyed with their mark in the ring and the arrow back,
 * and none of them is carried along.
 * A box neither done nor cancelled stays on its day once that is over and is carried
 * along on today: below the list of today, under `Carried along`, each with its day, like `Mon, 12.10.2026 · 00h 45m`,
 * the earliest first, see `boxesCarried` in `reader/boxes.ts`, until I do it, dragged into the log or with its ring,
 * cancel it with its cross, or push it with its arrow, there and on its own day alike, which takes it to tomorrow,
 * the day after today, not the day after its own, see `boxPush` in `reader/boxes.ts`; a click on it changes it,
 * like its day. It never moves into the next days by itself.
 * `+` beside the name of the plan opens the entry by category for a new box of the shown day; a click on a box changes it,
 * see `categories.ts`. A box without category, like a to-do another app wrote into the plan, opens the entry
 * by category of the log instead of being logged at once, when it is dropped or its ring tapped, since the log needs
 * a category; a box that cannot be changed, like an occurrence of a weekly lecture, is logged like any other,
 * and opens the entry by category of the log when clicked.
 * The list loads again when the shown day or its log changes, since a box is done once a log entry points to it,
 * when the entry by category closes, and after a push, a cancel or a suggestion accepted.
 *
 * - `fullcalendar/interaction`: Drags the boxes into the log.
 * - `./entries.ts`: Sends logged, taken back, pushed and cancelled boxes to the reader, and names who I will be with.
 * - `./categories.ts`: Opens the entry by category for a new box, a box to change, and a box to log through it.
 * - `./suggestions.ts`: Loads the study sessions suggested for tomorrow, accepts and dismisses them.
 * - `./gifts.ts`: Opens the dialog of the gift idea for a birthday or holiday.
 * - `./places.ts`: Gives the name of the place of a box, a link when it has one.
 * - `./times.ts`: Gives the times a box is logged at with one tap, and writes times of day.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Names the category of skill entries, writes a date as a day,
 *   and gives the day of a date.
 * - `../today.ts`: Gives today's calendar date, which tells whether the day of a box is over.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts icons into the buttons, their words as tooltip.
 * - `../menu.ts`: Puts the buttons of a box behind one button `⋯`.
 * - `../phone.ts`: Tells a phone, which shows a skill by its code alone.
 * - `lucide`: The icons plus, check, arrow, cross, undo, calendar crossed out and gift.
 * - `fullcalendar`: Calendar of the log the boxes are dropped into.
