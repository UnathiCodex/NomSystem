 * ## Evening
 *

 * of points with their bullets, see `points.ts`: my gratitude into the section `## Gratitude`, and my points
 * about the day overall into the section `## About`, both apart, though they go hand in hand.
 * Both are saved into the day's note a moment after I stop typing, and when I leave a list or the day;
 * the note below leaves both sections out.
 * It is all that is left of the evening panel: what happened is my log and the boxes for tomorrow are plan entries,
 * so neither is written any more, and the notes keep what they hold.
 *
 * - `./note.ts`: Loads and writes the sections of a daily note and shows the note.
 * - `./points.ts`: A list of points, each a bullet with its own field, like a Markdown list.
