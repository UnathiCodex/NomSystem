/**
 * ## Swipe
 *
 * Changes the shown day on a phone by a swipe sideways, as a calendar app does: a swipe to the left shows the day
 * after, one to the right the day before, and plan, log or note follow the finger meanwhile, see `--swipe`
 * in `day.css`. Only a clearly sideways move is a swipe, so nothing else of the day ever starts one:
 * - a move mostly up or down scrolls the time grid or the plan, as before;
 * - a finger resting longer than {@link restMs} before it moves is a press, so it selects a range in the time grid
 *   after 300 ms, or drags an entry after a second, see `selectLongPressDelay` in `day.ts`, and never swipes;
 * - an entry or a box being dragged, which turns the day itself at the edge, see `turnShow` in `day.ts`, never swipes;
 * - a touch in a dialog or a list over the page never swipes, since those lie outside the day.
 * A swipe beyond a quarter of the width, or a quick flick, changes the day: the shown part slides out at that side
 * and the new day slides in from the other; a shorter one slides back.

 * - `state`: `open` until the move shows its way, `swipe` while it follows the finger, `off` for anything else.
 * - `moved`: Pixels the finger moved sideways, positive to the right.
 * - `slide`: Moves the shown part to a place, sliding there or right there.
 * - `touchstart`: A new touch; a second finger, or one in a dialog, a list over the page or a drag, ends it.
 * - `touchmove`: Decides the way once the finger moved {@link startPx}, then moves the shown part with it, keeping
 *   the time grid from scrolling meanwhile; passive no more, so it may.
 * - `touchend`: Changes the day or slides back.
