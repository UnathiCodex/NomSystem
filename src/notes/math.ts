 *

 * MathJax 4.1 with the MathJax TeX font, output as HTML and CSS (CHTML), the same TeX packages and settings,
 * one call of `MathJax.tex2chtml` per formula and the stylesheet of the used characters after.
 * MathJax loads when the scripts view opens and puts itself onto `window` as `MathJax`;
 * the TeX packages and the whole font come as files from `node_modules`, which Vite serves while it runs,
 * as it serves Noto Sans, so nothing comes from a CDN.
 *
 * - `@mathjax/mathjax-tex-font/tex-mml-chtml-mathjax-tex.js`: MathJax with TeX input, CHTML output and the TeX font.

 * The calls of MathJax the scripts view uses, those Obsidian uses.
 *
 * - `startup.promise`: Settles when MathJax and its packages are loaded.
 * - `startup.document.options`: Options of the page MathJax renders for.
 * - `tex2chtml`: Turns TeX into HTML, `display` for a formula on its own line.
 * - `chtmlStylesheet`: Gives the stylesheet of MathJax, the same element each time: the first time with the rules
 *   of the characters used so far as its text, later with the rules of the new characters added into it.

 * - `startup.typeset`: Renders nothing at the start.
 * - `options`: No menu on a right click, no speech and no exploring, as in Obsidian.
