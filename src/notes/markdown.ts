/**
 * ## Markdown
 *
 * Turns the Markdown of a note into HTML as Obsidian reads it, with the Obsidian syntax my notes use:
 * - formulas `$…$` and `$$…$$`, taken whole before any other Markdown, so `_`, `*` and `\` inside stay TeX,
 *   while `$` inside code stays text; as in Obsidian, `$$…$$` within a line stands on a line of its own;
 * - callouts `> [!note] Title`, folded with `-` after the type, foldable with `+`;
 *   their lines without `>` and one space are read by the same rules as the rest of the note;
 * - wiki links `[[Note#Heading|Text]]`, embeds `![[Image.svg|300]]` and `![[Note]]`;
 * - a single line break as a break, as with Obsidian's strict line breaks off;
 * - a lazy line, one that goes on with the text of a list item without being indented, like the spacer `⠀`
 *   under a sub-bullet, as part of that item, as CommonMark reads it;
 * - an HTML block like `<table>` ending on the line its tag closes, as in Obsidian's editor,
 *   so Markdown right below it is read as Markdown;
 * - `|` inside `[[…]]` on a table row as part of the link, not as the end of a cell.
 * Beyond Obsidian, the block under each heading `##`, like a theory block or a task, folds by a click on its heading,
 * open at first, and the section under a heading `#### Solution…` comes folded, so I try a task before I see its solution;
 * so does the scene of a Definition or Algorithm, its `####` heading like `#### Ice Cream Kiosk`, since a rendered note
 * is looked up, and a lookup reads the theory as a clean card.
 * Also beyond Obsidian, every empty line between two blocks stays one line high, as I wrote it and as the editor
 * shows it, so the space between two blocks shows how many empty lines I wrote between them,
 * see {@link emptyLinesMade}.
 * Links, images and embeds keep their link as written in `data-link` and `data-heading`, for the scripts view
 * to resolve; formulas keep their TeX as text in an element of the class `math`, as in Obsidian,
 * for `math.ts` to render.
 * The HTML comes cleaned of scripts, as in Obsidian, because some notes in my modules come from the internet.
 *
 * - `marked`: Turns Markdown into HTML, with extensions for the syntax above.
 * - `dompurify`: Cleans HTML of scripts, event handlers and the like.
