/**
 * ## Session
 *
 * No learning recorded without a session: before the learning view records something, where I stand with `Next`,
 * a result or the round check, a session of the module runs, its skill entry of the moment, into which the record
 * goes, see `reader/skill.ts`; reading a section needs none. While none runs, the day view's own dialog of a new entry
 * opens over the page, the one I log every entry with in the calendar, see `../day/categories.ts`: `Skill` and the
 * module picked, from now, to the minute, as long as my usual session, see `sessionMinutes` in `reader/trackers.ts`;
 * I fill and save it there as always, and the record follows into it. Cancelled, or saved as no session running now,
 * nothing is recorded and I stay where I was. A session of the module running now, now between its start and its end,
 * counts without the dialog.
 * The dialog comes into the page only the first time it opens, see `./dialog.ts`, so the scripts load no calendar
 * before. The round shows the session it writes into beside its number, its day and times as the calendar writes
 * an entry, see {@link sessionTextOf}.
 *
 * - `./dialog.ts`: Puts the dialog of an entry of the day into the page, which opens for a new skill entry
 *   of the module.
 * - `../day/trackers.ts`: Loads my settings, with the minutes of my usual session.
 * - `../day/times.ts`: Gives now to the minute, as the day view writes its entries, and writes a time out.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Writes today's day in the form of the reader, and a day out as the page shows it.
 * - `../reader.ts`: Asks the reader.
