/**
 * ## Round
 *
 * The round of a section in the editor, the one view of a note: a section, a note with tasks of the semester, shows its
 * blocks, each `##` block, as the round holds them, never changing the text: only the current step stands on the page,
 * the text before and after it hidden, see {@link aloneOf}; every other block folded, the cold Task variants not due
 * this round like the Examples. Under the current step stands `Next`: it checks a block without a result off, like
 * theory, and opens the next; a task stays unchecked until my result, which only its check and cross on the line of its
 * heading write, the check going on as `Next` does, see `../skill/task.ts`, so `Next` stays off below an Example or a
 * Task until it has my result, and no block passes without one. In the head stands the round, like
 * `Round 1`, see {@link roundLineOf}, and beside it the session it writes into, see {@link sessionShow}; the tree lists
 * every block with its place, see `roundListOf` in `../notes/tree.ts`, and a click there shows a block alone, see
 * {@link roundHeadingShow}.
 * What a round holds, only what it needs; the other blocks wait, grey in the tree, those of one kind folded into one
 * line there:
 * - round 0, while the section learns the ladder, until a cold Task first comes back on a later day: every theory
 *   block in the order of the note, the Algorithm among them, and an older note's worked Examples, then one Example
 *   with gaps, the first, which gives almost every step, then one Task alone;
 *   that it is the first Example was Claude's choice, not mine;
 * - later: only the Task of today, once it is due.
 * A failure brings back one Example easier, the same day, see {@link fallbacksOf}: a wrong Task the last Example,
 * a wrong Example the one before it, a wrong first Example the Algorithm, read again; one Task per round decides when
 * the next round comes, see `reader/skill.ts`.
 * Where I am lives in the log alone, never in the browser or the note: `Next` writes the step it goes on to, where
 * I stand, into the one line `X-ROUND` of the section in the skill entry of the moment, written anew in its place,
 * and the reader gives it back with the section, see `RoundLine` in `reader/skill.ts`, so a round goes on where I left
 * it, in another sitting or on another day; the steps without a result before it, like theory, count as passed,
 * as do those an older line `seen` names.
 * A task counts as done by the log: in the ladder by any attempt, a Task once nothing of it is due today.
 * A click on a block in the tree, or on a link to its heading in the note, shows it alone, back or ahead, see
 * {@link roundHeadingShow}, and `Next` returns to the current step. The scene of a Definition, Lemma or Algorithm, its section
 * under a heading `####` like `#### Ice Cream Kiosk`, stands open in the round that holds the block, so the first time
 * I map it onto the theory; a block looked up, by a link or from the tree outside that round, shows its scene folded,
 * the theory a clean card, its arrow opening it, see {@link blockOpen}; the last step has no `Next`, since a round closes
 * only by hand, with the round check in the head, see {@link roundClose}, once its Task has a result and what a failure
 * of it brought back is done, see {@link closeShow}; the close writes `done` where the step stood, and Today follows;
 * once closed, a block opened has no `Next`, with no step to return to.
 * Reading a round needs no session, but `Next` and the round check write only in a session of the module, which
 * the dialog of a new entry starts while none runs, see `./session.ts`; cancelled, I stay where I was.
 * I write only in the block shown, see {@link changesKeep} and {@link selectionKeep}, so no key, cut or drag takes
 * `Next` or the hidden text around the block away.
 *
 * - `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`: Hold the block shown, keep what I write and select inside it,
 *   and draw `Next` as a widget below it.
 * - `@codemirror/language`: Folds and unfolds the blocks, as their arrows do.
 * - `./steps.ts`: Tells whether a block is folded.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Writes the days of the round line out, and the day of the next Task for the tree.
 * - `./tasks.ts`: Reads the blocks of the note with their tasks, and hears each load of the tasks, with its section,
 *   and each Right.
 * - `./session.ts`: Makes sure a session of the module runs before `Next` or the round check writes, and gives the
 *   session running, with its day and times written out.
 * - `./today.ts`: Lists what a failure brings back as cards, by {@link fallbacksOf}, so Today agrees with the round.
 * - `../notes/tree.ts`: The places of the blocks the tree shows.
