/**
 * ## Editor
 *
 * Edits a note of my modules or a Markdown file of my new system as its text, its Markdown shown as in Obsidian's
 * live preview away from the cursor, see `./preview.ts`. The scripts view, `/scripts`, is this editor, always writing,
 * with no view beside it to read only.
 * It edits the text of the file itself: saving writes exactly the edited text, nothing reformatted,
 * tabs, spacers `⠀` and soft hyphens, spaces at the ends of lines and the line breaks of the file as they were.
 * A note of my modules is saved right into its file in `NomSkillingmodules`, and the reader keeps each change
 * as a diff, so the AI learns my style from my corrections.
 * On the left the tree of one root, see `../notes/tree.ts`: `NomSkillingmodules` at `/scripts`, the outline of the note
 * under it, built anew as I write, whose headings scroll the note to them without loading the page again;
 * `NomManageplannings` for a file of my new system and at `/plannings`, where a click on a Markdown file of the three
 * folders of my new system, like `Foods.md`, `Places.md` or a daily note, opens it here to edit, saved back into its
 * file without a diff; an `.ics` file opens as its plain text, to read only, each block of it drawn one step in and its
 * entries apart, see `./ics.ts`; any other file shows in the tree, faint, and opens not.
 * A note of my modules shows the rows of its tasks under their headings, see `./tasks.ts`.
 * A section, a note with tasks of the semester, shows its round in the same view: its name in words, its round below
 * it, like `Round 1`, then only the block due, `Next` below it, and in the tree, in place of the outline, its blocks
 * with their places, a click opening one, see `./round.ts`.
 * While no note is open, the page asks to choose one, since the plan of the day says what is due; for the address of
 * a module or of one of its chapters, which a click on its name in the tree opens, like
 * `/scripts?module=IN2028_BusinessAnalyticsMachineLearning&chapter=01_RegressionAnalysis`, it shows the overview
 * of the module, its whole plan, its course of the university, see `./course.ts`, and where each of its sections
 * stands, see `./overview.ts`, the chapter picked in the tree.
 * The address names a note by its path in the scripts view and the heading to scroll to, like
 * `/scripts?path=IN2028_BusinessAnalyticsMachineLearning/01_RegressionAnalysis/01_01_SampleMeanEstimator.md#…`,
 * so a reload and the back button of the browser stay on it, and a file of my new system by its path in the tree,
 * like `/edit?file=NomMetainformations/Foods.md`; a section opens where its round stands, a block it shows from the
 * tree or a link staying out of the address, so a reload returns there.
 * Saves only with its button, the plain floppy disk of saving, so the round's check is the only check, its tooltip
 * `Save`, or Ctrl+S, never by itself, refused when the file changed on the disk since it was read, and asks before
 * leaving with changes unsaved, also for another file of the tree; the button faint while nothing is to save, its full
 * grey while there are changes, and beside it stands when it saved last, like `Saved 20:41`, or what went wrong.
 *
 * - `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`: The editor, CodeMirror 6, the engine of Obsidian's editor.
 * - `@codemirror/commands`: Undo, redo and the usual keys, Tab indenting a line.

 * - `./tasks.ts`: Shows the rows of the tasks of a note.
 * - `./round.ts`: Shows the round of a section in the note.

 * - `../notes/tree.ts`: Shows the tree of one root, the file shown marked, and the outline of a note or the blocks
 *   of a section with their places.
 * - `lucide`, `../icons.ts`: The floppy disk of the save button and the check of the round's button.
