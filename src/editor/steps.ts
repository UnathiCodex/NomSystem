/**
 * ## Steps
 *
 * The solutions of a note in the editor one step at a time, as on the card, see `stepsPut` in `../notes/notes.ts`:
 * once a solution, the section under `#### Solution…`, is unfolded, its first step shows, and below the solution
 * `Next step` shows the next one and `Show all` the rest. Its steps are those of the card: the items of its lists
 * in the order of the text, a parent before its own items, and its other blocks, like a formula of its own;
 * an empty line between two steps goes with the step after it.
 * Hiding is only for reading: the text stays as it is, the cursor stays at the end of the last step shown, also after End,
 * and the cursor going into a hidden step, like by the arrow keys or a new line, shows the whole solution,
 * so I edit it as before.
 * The solution of a worked Example, `## Example. …`, shows whole, spread out, since studying it whole is its point,
 * see {@link workedIs}.
 *
 * - `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`: Hold how many steps of each solution show, hide the others,
 *   and draw the buttons below the solution as a widget.
 * - `@codemirror/language`: Gives the syntax tree of the note, the section of a solution and whether it is folded.
