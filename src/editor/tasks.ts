 * the menu for the next attempt, which goes into the skill entry of the moment, Right and Wrong once its solution
 * is unfolded, Wrong with my short comment; after each attempt the rows load again. A cold task, its heading
 * ending with `(cold)`, shows a grey label in place of `(cold)`, like `cold · 2 done · 1 right`, while the cursor
 * is not on its heading.
 * Only a note with tasks of the semester has rows. A section, a note whose tasks make a section of the semester,
 * has no rows but on the line of each heading of an Example or a Task, at its right end, a check and a cross, its
 * results Right and Wrong, see `judgeOf` in `../skill/task.ts`, without state, hint or numbers, and its `(cold)`
 * hidden without a label, since its round says what is due, see `./round.ts`, which hears of each load and each Right,
 * see {@link tasksFollow}.
 *
 * - `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`: Hold the tasks of the note and draw the rows as widgets between its lines.
 * - `@codemirror/language`: Tells whether a solution is folded.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Loads the tasks with when they are due.
 * - `../today.ts`: Gives today's calendar date, for when a task is due.
 * - `../skill/task.ts`: Builds the row of a task, the check and the cross of a task of a section, and the label
