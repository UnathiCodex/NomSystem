/**
 * ## Router
 *
 * Opens one area of the life system beside the areas named in `index.html`, each shown by its icon there,
 * by the address:
 * the scripts, my notes of my modules in the editor, always writing, at `/scripts`, my new system at `/plannings`,
 * the food area at `/food`, the sport area at `/sport`, the editor of the files of my new system at `/edit`, the day everywhere else;
 * older addresses of the scripts, `/notes` and a note at `/edit?path=…`, open them too and become `/scripts`.
 * The editor shows a file of my new system under the link of `/plannings`, which opens the editor without a file,
 * and a note of my modules under that of `/scripts`, see `editor/editor.ts`.
 * Loads the code of the shown area only, with `import()`, so the day loads no MathJax and the scripts no calendar,
 * and puts the area's HTML into the page only once its code and its look are loaded, so it never shows unstyled;
 * the look of the whole page, `base.css` and `variants.css`, comes linked in `index.html` before any script.
 * A phone, a screen with the phone layout of the stylesheets, which `phone.ts` tells, opens the day everywhere,
 * its plan and its log alone, and `base.css` hides the areas, so the whole screen stays free;
 * every device tells the reader what it shows of the page, see {@link deviceReport}.
 *
 * - `vite/client`: Vite types for the type checker only, for `?raw` and stylesheets.
 * - `./day/day.html?raw`, `./food/food.html?raw`, `./sport/sport.html?raw`, `./editor/editor.html?raw`:
 *   Html of day, food, sport and editor as text, packed into the built code by Vite.
 * - `./day/day.ts`: Shows the log of a day, my one calendar, with the boxes of its plan beside it.
 * - `./food/food.ts`: Shows what I ate on a day with its totals, and my foods.
 * - `./sport/sport.ts`: Shows my sessions of sport on a day with what they burned, and my workouts and exercises.
 * - `./editor/editor.ts`: Edits a note of my modules or a Markdown file of my new system as its text, its Markdown
 *   shown as in Obsidian's live preview, saved exactly as edited, with the tree of its root on the left.
 * - `./phone.ts`: Tells a phone, which opens the day everywhere.
 * - {@link History#replaceState}: Turns an older address of the scripts into `/scripts`, without loading
 *   the page again.
