/**
 * ## Task
 *
 * What the views show of one task: when it is due, and its history folded behind a small button
 * that opens all its attempts, each with its day, its result and my comment on what went wrong, an older one also
 * with its time, its part, my effort, where I got stuck or why I skipped, and a link to the day; in the scripts view
 * and in a card, under the heading of the task, its row with one button `⋯` for the next attempt, as a box of the day
 * has, see `../menu.ts`; in a section, an Example or a Task of a round, a check and a cross on the line of its heading
 * instead, see {@link judgeOf}.
 * Its menu writes into the skill entry of the moment, through the reader's one writer of attempts, the task judged
 * as a whole: Right at once, Wrong opens one short field for my comment on what went wrong, which
 * Enter writes with it, also empty, and Escape closes without writing; only in a session of its module, which the
 * dialog of a new entry starts while none runs, see `../editor/session.ts`.
 * Right and Wrong work only once the solution of the task is open, so I judge against it, not by feeling, since
 * self-grading runs generous (León 2023); a task without a solution takes them always. A broken task I tell my tutor
 * in the chat.
 * A card keeps the row quiet, as quiet as a box of the day: only the `⋯`, after it grey the result of today once
 * there is one, like `wrong`, no state, no hint and no history.
 *
 * - `./attempts.ts`: Sends attempts, and writes days out.
 * - `../editor/session.ts`: Makes sure a session of the module of the task runs before an attempt is written.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts icons, alone or with words, into buttons.
 * - `../food/foods.ts`: Makes elements.
 * - `../menu.ts`: Puts the items for the next attempt behind one button `⋯`, and opens the field of my comment below
 *   the cross of a section as a menu.
 * - `lucide`: The icons of the history and of the items.
 * - `./task.css`: Look of the row and the history of a task.
