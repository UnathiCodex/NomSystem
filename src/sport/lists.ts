/**
 * ## Lists of the sport area
 *
 * My workouts and my exercises beside the day of the sport view, in this order, each section
 * built as my meals and foods in the food view, in their look, see `../food/meals.ts`: its name, the small grey plus
 * after it where it adds one, a search field where the list may grow long, then a small grey head and one flat line
 * per workout or exercise, the small grey `×` at its end, whose first click only asks,
 * the cross turning into the plain question mark, `Really remove?` as its tooltip.
 * Both come from one load of everything of mine, see `mineLoad` in `mine.ts`, and every change sends back all of
 * it, so an exercise added to a workout stands among my exercises.
 * - Workouts: each its name with its parts grey in brackets on one line, cut with … where they have no room, and what
 *   its videos burn, when all its parts are videos with minutes; a click opens it below, as a meal of the food view:
 *   its name, which changes in place, a click into it or on the small grey pencil after its name on top, and its parts
 *   in their order, each with its `×` while it has more than one, a video
 *   with its channel and its minutes, a click on it showing its minutes and its kind below it to change; the plus right
 *   after its name opens the search of my exercises and videos below its parts, see {@link partSearchOf}, which adds
 *   the one picked, `+ New exercise “Squat”` for a name typed that no exercise has, and a new video by its YouTube link
 *   pasted into it, the one place where a video comes in. The plus beside `Workouts`
 *   opens a field of a name, and a name typed in the search that no workout has offers `+ New workout “Legs”` last:
 *   either opens the new workout with its search, and its first part keeps it in `Workouts.md`.
 * - Exercises: mine, each with the workouts that hold it grey in brackets and what I do of it as a rule at the right,
 *   like `3 × 10 · 40 kg`; a click opens it below, its sets, its repetitions with their unit, `reps` or `s`, a switch,
 *   and its kilograms changing in place, which an entry brings every time, see `../day/sport.ts`, and the workouts
 *   that hold it too; one name may stand several times, each a variant with values of its own, like `Dips 3 × 10`
 *   and `Dips 4 × 8 · 10 kg`, and `+ New exercise “Dips”` adds one more, empty, opened to fill in;
 *   a search finds the basic ones of a gym
 *   below them, see `basicExercises` in `reader/sport.ts`, as the food search finds products, and a click makes one
 *   mine; the plus beside `Exercises` opens a field of a name,
 *   and a name typed in the search that no exercise has offers `+ New exercise “Squat”` last: either adds it to
 *   `Exercises.md` by itself; its `×` removes it from my workouts too.
 * My videos have no list of their own: they live in my workouts.
 * My weight, which the kcal need, I change in the totals of the day, see `sport.ts`, and the lists load anew after,
 * see {@link mineReload}, since the kcal of my workouts count with it.
 * Both load anew the moment a file of my new system changes, whoever changed it, like a workout changed on my phone,
 * see `../changes.ts`, as my meals in the food view, but not while the cursor stands in them, so nothing typed there
 * is lost.
 *
 * - `./mine.ts`: Loads, sends and removes my workouts and exercises, sends my videos, and asks YouTube for a link.
 * - `../food/foods.ts`: Makes elements and buttons, the brackets of a list kept alike.
 * - `../food/search.ts`: The head and the lines of every list, the fields of a change in place and the cross and the
 *   check of a form.
 * - `../day/times.ts`: Writes a length of time.
 * - `../search.ts`: Compares the text typed in a search with the names of a list.
 * - `../changes.ts`: Loads everything of mine anew the moment a file of my new system changes.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts the one plus and the one `×` into the buttons, and the plain question mark, their words
 *   as tooltip, and makes every search field.
 * - `lucide`: The plus of a new workout or exercise, and the pencil that renames a workout.
