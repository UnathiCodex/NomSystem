/**
 * ## Sport
 *
 * Shows my sessions of sport on a day, and my workouts and exercises, in the scheme of the food view,
 * whose look it takes, see `../food/food.css`.
 * The bar of the day, as the day has it: its weekday written out, small and grey above its date, like `Saturday`
 * over `17.10.2026`, between the arrows to the day before and after, a small icon beside it back to today, faded
 * and off on today.
 * The day: the number of its sessions, their time together and the kcal they burned above rest, an estimate, see
 * `reader/sport.ts`, written whole without `~`, since every kcal of the page is rounded anyway, without goals, so the
 * log stays a log; then each session of the log: its start,
 * linking to the day in the day view, and its kcal in bold, below it its kind and its workout with its time, like
 * `Gym · Push`, and below that, indented, what I did: each exercise with its sets, repetitions and kilograms,
 * like `3 × 10 · 40 kg`, and each video with its channel grey and its minutes. A session counts 0 kcal while I have
 * no weight, and so do the totals, never an empty place.
 * Last among the totals, also on a day without sessions, my weight on the day, the last one I wrote on or before it,
 * like `60.5 kg`, with a small grey pencil, only the pencil while I have none: a click turns it into a field in its
 * place, Enter or leaving it writes the weight of the shown day, Escape takes it back, see {@link weightEdit}; I change
 * it every month or two, so it needs no place of its own, and the kcal of the day and of my videos count with it anew.
 * Beside the day my workouts and exercises, see `lists.ts`.
 * It opens on today's calendar date, which turns at 00:00, also after a reload, and while it shows today it moves on
 * with it; only a link like `/sport?date=2026-10-10` opens on that day, see `today.ts`.
 *
 * - `./mine.ts`: Loads the sessions of a day with what they took, and sends my weight of a day.
 * - `./lists.ts`: The sections of my workouts, exercises and videos, loaded anew after my weight changed.
 * - `../food/foods.ts`: Writes amounts and makes elements.
 * - `../day/times.ts`: Writes a length of time, like `01h 10m`, and a day as its date, like `17.10.2026`.
 * - `../skill/attempts.ts`: Writes a date as a day in the form of the reader.
 * - `../today.ts`: Gives today's calendar date and the day a link asks for, and moves the sport view on to the new day
 *   while it shows today.
 * - `../icons.ts`: Puts the arrows and the icon back to today into their buttons, their words as tooltip, and makes
 *   the pencil of my weight.
 * - `lucide`: The icons of the arrows, of today and the pencil.
 * - `../food/food.css`, `../food/search.css`, `../food/meals.css`: Look of the food view, which the sport view takes.
 * - `./sport.css`: What the sport view adds to it.
