 * ## Today
 *

 * see `livedDayOf` in `skill/attempts.ts`, so at 00:20 on 14.10.2026 the day, the week and the food open
 * on 14 October; the trackers, the skill days and the done boxes still count the day I live.
 * A view that shows today moves on to the new day by itself at 00:00, and when the page becomes visible again
 * on a later day, like a tab left open overnight, whose timer the browser may have held back; a day I went to myself
 * stays, and only marks today anew, like the `Today` button of the day and the row of today in the week.
 * A view opens on today, also when it is reloaded, opened again by the browser or started anew as the app;
 * only a link to a day, like a row of the week, opens on that day, see {@link askedDayOf}.
 *
 * - `./skill/attempts.ts`: Writes a date as a day in the form of the reader.
