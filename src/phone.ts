/**
 * ## Phone
 *
 * Tells the code whether the page shows on a phone: a screen at most 900 CSS pixels wide, like my phone's 388,
 * or a screen I touch with a finger at most 1366 wide, like my tablet's 1067 lying and 428 standing, which shows
 * the phone layout too, always. That is the one condition at which the whole dashboard changes to its phone layout,
 * the plan and the log of a day alone, see `main.ts`: every stylesheet a phone uses ends in one block
 * `@media (max-width: 900px), (pointer: coarse) and (max-width: 1366px)`, which holds all its rules for a phone,
 * and the code asks {@link phone} for what a stylesheet cannot do, like a skill shown by its code alone. My PC and
 * my laptop, 1920 and 1601 wide and used with a mouse, are far above it, so they keep their layout.
