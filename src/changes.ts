/**
 * ## Changes
 *
 * Loads what a view shows anew the moment a file of my new system changes, whoever changed it: this page, another
 * page, another device, or Claude through the reader, like a food renamed in every entry that holds it, since the
 * reader tells every open page so, see `reader/changes.ts`. So no view shows what the files held before.
 * The page hears the reader on one open answer for all its views; once it hears the reader again after losing it,
 * like a phone whose app lay in the background, or the reader started anew after a change of its code, every view
 * loads anew too, since a change may have come meanwhile.
 * What a dialog needs, like the categories of the entry by category, is kept the same way, loaded once and anew
 * after every change, so opening the dialog waits for no answer of the reader, see {@link changesKept}.
 *
 * - {@link EventSource}: Keeps one answer of the reader open, hears each change on it, and asks again by itself
 *   when it breaks.
