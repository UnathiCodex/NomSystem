/**
 * ## Skill
 *
 * Reads the tasks of my chapter notes and my attempts at them, tells when each task is due,
 * and writes the skill entries of the log: the one writer of their chapters, documents and attempts,
 * for the scripts view and the entry by category alike.
 * Only the modules of the semester have tasks, see `activeModules`; their chapters and tasks are read live
 * from the folders every time, so a changed chapter changes the views too, and no list of them is kept anywhere.
 * A task is a block of a note of a chapter folder like `01_RegressionAnalysis` in my modules,
 * its kind by the type word of its heading: `## Example. <name>` with `Given:` and `Missing:` lines is faded,
 * an example with gaps, those lines saying what it gives and what I fill in; `## Task. <name>` is cold, the one
 * I solve alone, one of its variants due per round; a `## Definition.` and the `## Algorithm.`, the one worked
 * example, are theory.
 * An older note keeps its meaning: an Example with only a `#### Solution` is worked, one without it theory,
 * and `## Completion. <name>` faded; a heading `## Task. <name> (cold)` is cold, `(cold)` no part of its name,
 * and each plain `## Task. <name>` there faded with `Given:` and `Missing:` lines, else worked.
 * Its sources are the `>` lines right below its heading, one per source, each starting with its mode word,
 * `Original:` or `Generated:`, which is left out,
 * like `> Generated: [[VO_UniversityLectureLessons/TUM_2025W/01_CourseOverview.pdf#page=45|VO 2025W 01 CourseOverview (45)]]`.
 * The parts of a cold task, one per idea, are its numbered list items at the start of a line,
 * like `1. Sales $X_1,X_2,X_3$ of three days`, before its solution.
 *
 * A skill entry of the log is one block of learning of a type, as in the plan: a lecture or a tutorial I attended,
 * a homework sheet I worked on, or study, solving the tasks of my notes, of any module of `NomSkillingmodules`,
 * also one of another semester I attend: `CATEGORIES:Skill`, its `SUMMARY` the name of the folder of its module
 * with its type in round brackets, linking the folder, for a type on into that of its material, as `ALTREP`,
 * without `X-MODULE` and `X-TYPE`,
 * `SUMMARY;ALTREP="NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/VO_…/TUM_2026W":IN2028_BusinessAnalyticsMachineLearning (VO)`,
 * see `documents.ts`; or a block of work on a project of the semester, see `activeSkills` in `sources.ts`,
 * which behaves like a module without chapters and tasks, named by its folder, like `SUMMARY:WokFlow`;
 * the type may stay empty for any skill, like my own learning. Below them, each only when there is one:
 * - one `ATTACH` per real document it used, like the slides of a lecture, the sheet of an exercise or the notes
 *   of a chapter, just its path, a file of the university with the fingerprint of its content, so the link survives
 *   a rename, a note without, since I change my notes too often, see `documents.ts`; the learning view attaches
 *   the note of each section I learn in it, like
 *   `ATTACH:NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/01_RegressionAnalysis/01_01_SampleMeanEstimator.md`;
 *   its `DESCRIPTION` is only my free note;
 * - its semester, `X-SEMESTER`, see `semesterFor` in `categories.ts`;
 * - one `X-CHAPTER` per chapter of my system it belongs to, of any type,
 *   like `X-CHAPTER:02_LogisticPoissonRegression`, several for a session over several chapters, like exam training,
 *   the chapters of the tasks of its attempts always among them; an older entry that links the folder of a chapter
 *   instead gets its `X-CHAPTER` once it changes, see `chaptersOf` in `documents.ts`;
 * - one `X-ATTEMPT` per attempt at a task of my notes, of any type, like the tasks I solved in a tutorial:
 *   the name of its task, whose module the summary names, its result, right or wrong, the task judged as a whole,
 *   and for a wrong one my short comment on what went wrong, see {@link AttemptLine}, like
 *   `X-ATTEMPT:Kiosk Chain;right` and `X-ATTEMPT:Kiosk Chain;wrong;Step 2: weights add up to 1.2, not 1`;
 *   no time, since the entry has its start and its end, and the order of the lines is the order of the attempts.
 *   An older one names its task with its module, may start with the time of the tap, like `140500` or `14:05`,
 *   may name the part of a cold task after `#`, and has my effort before its sentence, where I got stuck, why
 *   I skipped, or what went wrong, like `X-ATTEMPT:140500;IN2028/Kiosk Chain Review#2;stuck;high;step 2`
 *   or `X-ATTEMPT:IN2028/Kiosk Sales Standard Error;right`; it is read as it is, also its results guided, stuck
 *   and skipped and its effort, which nothing writes any more;
 * - one `X-ROUND` per section I learn in it, where I stand in its round, see {@link RoundLine}, written anew in its
 *   place as I go on, like `X-ROUND:01_01_SampleMeanEstimator;1;Algorithm. Check an Estimator for Bias`, then
 *   `X-ROUND:01_01_SampleMeanEstimator;1;done` once I closed the round;
 * - an older entry may hold one `X-TUTOR` per task I copied for my tutor in it, like
 *   `X-TUTOR:IN2028/Kiosk Sales Standard Error`, from when the views copied a task for my tutor; nothing writes
 *   them any more, and they are only read, so the chapters of their tasks still count among the entry's.
 * The forms above are the values of `X-ATTEMPT` and `X-ROUND`; the file holds them as text of the standard, each `;`,
 * `,` and `\` escaped by a `\`, like `X-ATTEMPT:Kiosk Chain\;right`, see `calendar.ts`.
 * A button of a task writes into the skill entry of the moment: the last one of the task's module that started before now
 * and ended at most half an hour ago, like a tutorial logged from the plan; it grows to the end of the quarter hour
 * of the attempt, so the half hour of a pause counts from the attempt.
 * Without one, a new entry starts, covering the quarter hour of the attempt, in the steps of the day view: of the type
 * of the open skill box of the module for now, logged from it, so the attempts do the box, see `skillBoxOf`
 * in `boxes.ts`, else without type, my own learning, like `IN2028`.
 * The skill entry of the moment of any module is the session running now, whose timer the page shows
 * when it is of a type I pace myself, my own learning or homework, see {@link sessionRead}.
 * Due by my protocol, per section, a note like `01_01_SampleMeanStandardError.md`, whose cold task carries its runs
 * (decisions 73 to 76 in `.claude/life/decisions.md`): a task of the ladder is new until tried, done once right,
 * and due 2 days after a wrong, stuck or guided attempt, until its section has its first cold run, after which
 * the ladder leaves the due list, since guidance hurts once a type is known (Tetzlaff 2025).
 * The cold task is one run of its section: an attempt judges it as a whole, and the run counts once it is right
 * on or after the day it was due; a failed one comes back 2 days later, and the section steps back one run instead
 * of to none (Rawson 2018); an older attempt may judge one of its parts, and its run counted once every part sat.
 * After the first run, mostly the Task of round 0, the section is due 1 day later, after the second 7 days later,
 * after the third 21 days later; after the fourth it is ready, three runs spaced after the first,
 * and comes back about 14 days before its exam, with one keep-up check halfway when the exam lies more than 6 weeks
 * off, see {@link exams} (Cepeda 2008, Rohrer 2005).
 * A right attempt before its day counts as none, so the runs stay spaced; a guided one, right with my tutor's help,
 * counts as none either, and the task is due 2 days later, cold.
 * A skipped task leaves the due list until its next attempt.
 *
 * - `./boxes.ts`: Finds the skill box of a module for now, marks a box done once a skill entry is logged from it,
 *   and reads the skill boxes of the plan, for the exam of each module.
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Reads the log, appends entries to it, changes their events, and adds days to a day.
 * - `./categories.ts`: Names the category and the types of skill entries and writes what a skill entry was.
 * - `./day.ts`: Gives the log an entry belongs into, the log of its skill.
 * - `./documents.ts`: Builds the links of a skill entry, to the folder of its skill, to its documents
 *   with their fingerprints and to the folders of its chapters.
 * - `./notes.ts`: Reads the modules of the semester with their chapters and notes, and every module folder.
 * - `./places.ts`: Gives the link of the place of a skill entry.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names the skill log and the skills of the semester, its modules and its projects,
 *   and the folder of my modules.
