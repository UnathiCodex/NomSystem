/**
 * ## Categories
 *
 * Entry by category, for plan and log alike: a fixed list of categories, each with its fields, named as the file
 * names them, its `Summary`, its `SUMMARY`, its `Place`, its `LOCATION`, and `With`, who I was with, its `ATTENDEE`s,
 * like `Way` with `Summary`, `From`, `Place` and `With`.
 * Each field of a what offers its values from the log itself, the what of its entries of the category,
 * the most used first, equal ones alphabetical.
 * Places are one list for every field of a place, the place of an entry and where a way starts: only my places
 * of `Places.md`, each as a line with its address, like `TUM Innenstadt, Arcisstraße 21, 80333 München, Deutschland`,
 * see `places.ts`, and `Online`, the place of a meeting online, but in a way, which leads from one place of mine
 * to another, see {@link offlineNames}; the most used by the entries of the log first, counted by their names.
 * `Online` takes its parts and its link typed per entry, its software, who offers it and its passcode,
 * see `onlineName` in `places.ts`.
 * `With` takes one or more people or groups, each by a name without comma, mostly one group, like `Socials`,
 * sometimes several, like `Sophale, Willi`, offering the names the entries of the log wrote, the most used first,
 * equal ones alphabetical, with the address the last of them wrote, see {@link addressesOf}; there is no file
 * of people.
 * A value offered in the code may come with steps, which the dialog shows while it is picked, and below them
 * the note of the last entry of it, like `Last time: band red · 3×10`, so the load can rise.
 * `Body` is my body care, showering and any care, offering `Shower` before any use; my neck routine,
 * `Neck short` and `Neck long`, is no what of it any more, also where the log holds it, see {@link retiredWhats}.
 * A dish, the what of `Food` and `Cook`, names its foods parted by `, `, like `Reis, Bohnen, Eier`.
 * `Shopping` is what I buy, its what as I type it, like `Brot, Milch`, its place the shop, like `Edeka Center Hadern`.
 * `Event` is what I go to that is no skill, like an evening at a company, its what as I type it, its place where it is,
 * which I add with its address and link like any place of mine.
 * `Sleep` takes only two whats, `Night` and `Day`, a nap, see {@link sleepWhats}, and no new ones,
 * so the sleep tracker tells a nap from a night, see `trackers.ts`; `Way` takes only my means of transport,
 * see {@link transports}.
 * `Skill` has only the fields `Place`, like the room of a lecture, and `With`: in plan and log a skill, a module
 * by its code or a project by its name, and a type or none, which the dialog picks itself, written as its skill airy
 * with the type in brackets, like `IN2028 Business Analytics Machine Learning (VO)` or `WokFlow`,
 * see `activeSkills` in `sources.ts` and {@link skillTypes};
 * in the log also its documents and its attempts, which only the skill area writes, see `skill.ts`.
 * A box of the plan takes only what I intend and would otherwise forget, so not `Sleep`, `Food`, `Cook`, `Drink`
 * and `Game`, which happen anyway, see {@link unplannedNames}; `Watch` stays, since a cinema or a match has its time.
 * `Drink` is no category I pick: water has its own tracker, whose counter writes each glass as an entry `Drink`
 * of five minutes, see `trackers.ts`, and takes no time of mine, so the dialog leaves it out, see {@link hiddenNames}.
 *
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Reads `.ics` files into entries, and names the category of skill entries.
 * - `./places.ts`: Reads my places from `Places.md`.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names every folder and file the reader reads.
