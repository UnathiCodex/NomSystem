/**
 * ## Trash
 *
 * Puts a file or a folder into the trash of the user the reader runs as, never removing anything for good, as the desktop
 * does it, by the Trash specification of freedesktop.org: the thing goes into `~/.local/share/Trash/files/`, and beside
 * it into `info/` a file `<name>.trashinfo` with the path it had and when it went, so `gio trash --restore`
 * and a file manager can bring it back. A name the trash holds already gets a number before its ending,
 * like `hello_Vu 2`. What Vu and I share and our messages go there once done, see `shared.ts` and `gate.ts`.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Moves the thing and writes its information.
 * - `node:os`: Gives the home folder.
 * - `node:path`: Builds the paths of the trash.
