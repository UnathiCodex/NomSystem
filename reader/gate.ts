/**
 * ## Gate
 *
 * The one thing the key of a person I share with may do on my server, like Vu's key `vu@skriptum`: SSH runs this file
 * for that key, whatever the key asks, since `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` of my server names it before the key with
 * `restrict`, which allows no shell, no forwarding and no terminal, my name first, then the person's, like
 * `restrict,command="/usr/bin/node /home/sopha/NomWorkspace/NomSystemdashboard/reader/gate.ts Sopha Vu" ssh-ed25519 …`.
 * What the key asks stands in `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND`, a command and maybe a path after one space,
 * like `get to_vu/2026-10-20_2113_gemeinsame-listen-und-with.md`; the gate does only these commands, all inside
 * `NomKommunikation`, see `kommunikationRoot` in `sources.ts`, and refuses every other, telling which there are.
 * In both boxes, theirs like `to_vu/` and mine like `to_sopha/`, the person may do whatever they want, as I may:
 * - `readme`: Gives `README.md` of `NomKommunikation`, which says how we write to each other.
 * - `list`: Lists every file of both boxes by its path, like `to_vu/2026-10-15_studien-nacht/CLAIMS.tsv`,
 *   but those of `dashboard/`.
 * - `get <path>`: Gives one file of a box, like `to_vu/2026-10-15_studien-nacht/CLAIMS.tsv`.
 * - `put <path>`: Writes what comes in into a file of a box, like `to_sopha/2026-10-21_0930_antwort.md`,
 *   or into a folder of it, like `to_sopha/2026-10-21_0930_antwort/Tabelle.tsv`, a file there or not.
 * - `delete <path>`: Puts a file or folder of a box into the trash of my server, see `trash.ts`.
 * - `share <name>`: Writes what comes in into `dashboard/` of my box: an entry, a food, a meal or a place the dashboard
 *   of the person shares with mine, named by the moment, the person and what it is,
 *   like `20261021T093000123Z_Vu_entry_….ics`, see `shared.ts`.
 * - `hello`: Tells my dashboard that the dashboard of the person runs again, so it sends what waits for them.
 * A path is parted by `/`, each part letters, digits, spaces and `._()+,&'-`, not starting with a dot, so it holds
 * no `..` and names no hidden file, and every file it reads or writes lies inside the box after symbolic links
 * are followed. A new file is written beside under a hidden name first, then renamed, so no one sees half of it.
 * Says `ok` after a write and the reason of a refusal on the error output, with the exit code 1, 2 for an unknown
 * command.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Lists, reads, writes and moves the files of the boxes.
 * - `node:path`: Builds the paths of the boxes.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names `NomKommunikation`.
 * - `./trash.ts`: Puts what is deleted into the trash.
