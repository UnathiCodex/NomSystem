/**
 * ## Day
 *
 * Reads the log of a day, my one calendar, and adds, changes and removes its entries, by category, see `categories.ts`;
 * the plan of the day is a list of boxes beside it, see `boxes.ts`.
 * Writes into the logs of the new system, see `sources.ts`: a skill entry into the log of its skill,
 * like `University/IN2028_BusinessAnalyticsMachineLearning_Log.ics`, any other into the log of its month in Berlin time,
 * like `Living/2026_10_Log.ics`; an entry whose start moves into another month, or that changes its category or its skill,
 * moves into the log it belongs into then, as one from a month file of the layout before.
 * A skill entry names the folder of its skill and its type in its `SUMMARY` alone, linking the folder:
 * `CATEGORIES:Skill`,
 * `SUMMARY;ALTREP="NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…":IN2028 Business Analytics Machine Learning (VO)`,
 * without `X-TYPE` and `X-MODULE`, also one logged from a box, see `titleOf` in `documents.ts`;
 * its chapters, document and attempts only `skill.ts` writes.
 * A change from the dialog is written only while the file holds the entry as the dialog opened it, see
 * {@link entryEdit}, and a drag writes only the new start and end, see {@link entryMove}, so no page writes back
 * what the file held before, like a food renamed in every entry since.
 *
 * A box of the plan goes into the log at its real time, dragged there or logged as expected with one tap,
 * see {@link boxLog}: the log entry points to it with the standard `RELATED-TO:<UID of the box>`, for one date
 * of a series with that date, like `RELATED-TO;X-RECURRENCE-ID=20261026T130000Z:<UID>`, see `relatedOf`
 * in `calendar.ts`, written once when the log entry is added, also when a box is logged through the dialog,
 * so the box shows as done, with expected and real time, and offers no second log; removing the log entry opens
 * the box again, and so does one click on the check of the done box, see {@link boxUndo}. An older log entry points
 * to its box with `X-PLANNED:<UID of the box>`, which is still read.
 *
 * The dialog of a new box takes the median of how long the last entries like it really lasted as its length,
 * see {@link realMinutesRead}.
 * The search of the log reads every entry of it, see {@link logAllRead}.
 * The timer of the day reads the entry running now, see {@link entryNowRead}.
 *
 * A meal of the log lists its foods as lines `X-FOOD`, like `X-FOOD:Skyr natur;K-Classic;Kaufland;150`: appended
 * with the entry, and replaced as a whole when the entry changes; the reader counts what each meal gives, see `food.ts`.
 * A cooking, `Cook`, lists what went into the pot the same way, like `X-FOOD:Hackfleisch;Gut & Günstig;Edeka;500`,
 * which counts nothing; a meal drawn from it holds `X-COOKED:<UID of the Cook entry>` and the foods it ate with their
 * grams, so each keeps its foods in its own lines, which follow every change of the cooking, see {@link cookedShare};
 * a link only ever points back in time, see {@link cookedCheck}.
 * A session of sport, `Sport`, holds what I did as its own lines, its exercises `X-EXERCISE` and its videos `X-VIDEO`,
 * each with its workout, see `sport.ts`: appended with the entry, and each kind replaced as a whole when the entry
 * changes it; the `X-WORKOUT` of a session written before goes once the entry changes.
 *
 * - `./boxes.ts`: Finds a box of the plan, an open one, and marks a box done or open again.
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Reads `.ics` files into entries, appends, changes and removes their events.
 * - `./categories.ts`: Tells whether the fields of an entry fit its category, and names the category of skill entries.
 * - `./documents.ts`: Writes what a skill entry was, linking the folder of its skill, gives its chapters,
 *   and the log an entry belongs into.
 * - `./food.ts`: Tells what meals give and whether a line `X-FOOD` is well formed.
 * - `./sport.ts`: Tells whether the lines of a session of sport are well formed.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names every folder and file the reader reads.
 * - `./trackers.ts`: Tells whether an entry is a glass of water.
