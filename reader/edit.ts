 * exactly the text sent, nothing reformatted, and first adds the change as a unified diff to the end of the file
 * of my corrections, so the AI can turn them into rules of my style, see `editor` in `sources.ts`.
 * Paths are those of the scripts view, from `NomSkillingmodules`, like
 * `IN2028_BusinessAnalyticsMachineLearning/01_RegressionAnalysis/01_01_SampleMeanEstimator.md`.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Reads and writes files.
 * - `node:path`: Builds file paths for the operating system.
 * - `diff`: Writes a change as a unified diff, as `git diff` does.
 * - `temporal-polyfill`: Gives the time in Berlin, for the head of a diff.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names the folder of my modules and the file of my corrections.
