/**
 * ## Suggestions
 *
 * Puts what I learn today into the plan of today as real boxes, without asking: one box per chapter with something
 * due today, a Task by its spacing or a section on round 0, see `today` of `SkillSection` in `skill.ts`, the same
 * chapters Learn shows, see `src/editor/today.ts`; none before the day my learning starts, see `learningStart`
 * in `trackers.ts`. A box of my own learning, without type and without time,
 * like a to-do, since only its length matters, not when: 30 minutes for the Task of each section with something due,
 * and 30 more for the theory of a section on round 0, its Definitions, Algorithm and Example, see `taskMinutes`
 * and `theoryMinutes` in `trackers.ts`, like `SUMMARY:IN2028 Business Analytics Machine Learning`
 * with `X-CHAPTER:01_RegressionAnalysis` and `ESTIMATED-DURATION:PT2H` for 01.03 on round 0 with the Tasks
 * of 01.01 and 01.02, see `boxes.ts`, and one `ATTACH` per note of the chapter with something due,
 * at most one Task each, like `ATTACH:NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/01_RegressionAnalysis/01_01_SampleMeanEstimator.md`,
 * as it stands when the box is written; its real length the log keeps.
 * A chapter gets no box while the plan of today holds a study box of it, one without time and deadline, as
 * `studyBoxOf` in `boxes.ts` takes it, open, done, skipped or pushed away, nor while such a box of it from a day before
 * is still open: that one is carried along until I do it, see `boxesCarried` in `boxes.ts`, and once done by a log
 * entry of today stands in the plan of today too, see `boxesRead` there, like the box of 18.10 done by my session
 * of 19.10. A box of the chapter with a time or a deadline, like a lecture or a homework sheet, keeps none out.
 * Learning does the box: the session the learning view opens and the attempts of a session are logged from it,
 * see `studyBoxOf` in `boxes.ts`. Written before the plan of today or the learning view is read, see `reader.ts`,
 * so the box stands there before I begin; nothing written is taken out again.
 *
 * - `./boxes.ts`: Reads the boxes of today and those carried along, and adds a box.
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Gives today in Berlin time and adds a day to a day.
 * - `./categories.ts`: Names the category of skill entries.
 * - `./skill.ts`: Reads what of each section is due today.
 * - `./trackers.ts`: Holds the minutes of a Task and of the theory of a new section.
