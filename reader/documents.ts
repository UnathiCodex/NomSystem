/**
 * ## Documents
 *
 * Names a skill entry and links it to the folder of its skill and to the documents it used, like the slides
 * of a lecture, a sheet or the notes of a chapter, its paths from `NomWorkspace`;
 * each link only points to more, the entry states its facts itself, see `calendar.ts`, like the chapters
 * of my system it belongs to, one `X-CHAPTER` each, like `X-CHAPTER:02_LogisticPoissonRegression`.
 * Its `SUMMARY` names its skill airy, a module by its code and the words of its title, see {@link skillLabelOf},
 * with its type in round brackets at the end when it has one, see {@link skillTitleOf}, and links the folder
 * of the skill as its `ALTREP` while I type no web address in its place, see {@link titleOf}, for a module with a type
 * on into the folder of the material of its type and of its semester, as far as they hold files, see
 * {@link skillLinkOf}, like
 * `SUMMARY;ALTREP="NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/VO_UniversityLectureLessons/TUM_2026W":IN2028 Business Analytics
 * Machine Learning (VO)`, my own learning without brackets, linking the module folder, a project by its folder name,
 * like `SUMMARY;ALTREP="NomProgramprojects/AsiaWok_Wokflow_2026":WokFlow`.
 * Every real document a skill entry used is one `ATTACH` holding just its path, see `Link` in `calendar.ts`,
 * as many as it used, in the same form for every kind: a lecture its slides, like
 * `ATTACH;X-SHA256=9f86d081…:NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/VO_…/TUM_2026W/04_LogisticRegression.pdf`,
 * an exercise or a tutorial its sheet in `TU_UniversityTutorExercises`, a homework its sheet
 * in `HU_UniversityHomeExercises`, and my own learning the notes of its chapters, like
 * `ATTACH:NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/01_…/01_01_SampleMeanStandardError.md`.
 * The name of the file says what it is and its `X-CHAPTER`s what the session was about, so a document has no name
 * of my own; a file of the university keeps the fingerprint of its content, the SHA-256 of its bytes, as parameter,
 * so the link survives a rename; a note has none, since I change my notes too often, and is found by its name,
 * see {@link linksRepairOf}; a note an older entry links with its fingerprint keeps it.
 * An older `X-TOPIC` beside the path is no more read, and goes once the entry changes.
 * The folder of a chapter is no `ATTACH`: an older entry that links one names that chapter, which is still read,
 * see {@link chaptersOf}, and becomes its `X-CHAPTER` once the entry changes; its `DESCRIPTION` is only my free note.
 * The folder of a module in an `ATTACH` of an older entry counts no more and goes once the entry changes too.
 * The reader checks every link of the whole log when it starts and every night at 04:00, see {@link linksCheckStart}:
 * a module folder that is gone, like after a rename, is found again by the code of the entry's module,
 * see `moduleFolderOf` in `notes.ts`, and its `SUMMARY` names the module of the folder found, also that of an entry
 * linking a web address I typed, which keeps it, since a web page is on no disk; a document whose path no longer leads
 * to a file, like after a rename or a move into another folder of the module, is looked for by its fingerprint
 * among the module's documents, a note without fingerprint by its name, like one an older entry links among
 * my drafts in `.claude`, once it lies in the module folder, and a chapter by the name of its folder
 * in the module folder found.
 * Each repair goes into the entry, every other line of the file as it is, and into the reader's console, with the old
 * and the new path. A link it cannot repair stays as written, like a document deleted or the folder of a project,
 * which has no code to find it by, and the skill view lists it, see {@link linksLostRead}.
 * Fingerprints are kept by path, size and time of change, so only new or changed files are read again.
 * The reader sends a file a skill entry links, read only, so the page opens it in the browser's own viewer,
 * see {@link linkedFileRead}; no other file of `NomWorkspace`.
 * By the folder of its skill a skill entry also finds its log and a skill box its plan, any other entry or box
 * the log or the plan of its year, see {@link calendarFileOf}.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Reads files and their sizes and times of change.
 * - `node:path`: Builds file paths for the operating system.
 * - `node:crypto`: Computes the SHA-256 of a file.
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Reads the log, finds an entry's event, puts new values into it or changes its fields,
 *   writes its start and the days in Berlin time, and names the category of skill entries.
 * - `./notes.ts`: Finds the folder of a module by its code and of a chapter by its name, lists the documents
 *   of a module, names a folder to read, and gives the content type of a file.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names `NomWorkspace`, the folder of my modules, the skills of the semester
 *   and the log of the skill area, and builds the paths of the files of plan and log of a year and of a skill.
