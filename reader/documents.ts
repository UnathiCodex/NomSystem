/**
 * ## Documents
 *
 * Names a skill entry and links it to the folder of its skill and to the documents it used, like the slides
 * of a lecture, a sheet or the notes of a chapter, its paths from `NomWorkspace`;
 * each link only points to more, the entry states its facts itself, see `calendar.ts`, like the chapters
 * of my system it belongs to, one `X-CHAPTER` each, like `X-CHAPTER:02 Logistic Poisson Regression`.
 * Its `SUMMARY` is the name of the folder of its skill, with its type
 * in round brackets at the end when it has one, and links that folder as its `ALTREP`, see {@link skillTitleOf},
 * like `SUMMARY;ALTREP="NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…":IN2028_BusinessAnalyticsMachineLearning (VO)`,
 * my own learning without brackets, a project like
 * `SUMMARY;ALTREP="NomProgramprojects/AsiaWok_Bonierungssystem_2026/WokFlow":WokFlow`.
 * Every real document a skill entry used is one `ATTACH` holding just its path, see `Link` in `calendar.ts`,
 * as many as it used, in the same form for every kind: a lecture its slides, like
 * `ATTACH;X-SHA256=9f86d081…:NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/VO_…/TUM_2026W/04_LogisticRegression.pdf`,
 * an exercise or a tutorial its sheet in `TU_UniversityTutorExercises`, a homework its sheet
 * in `HU_UniversityHomeExercises`, and my own learning the notes of its chapters, like
 * `ATTACH;X-SHA256=…:NomSkillingmodules/IN2028_…/01_…/01_01_SampleMeanStandardError.md`, or of a chapter
 * without notes in the module those of its unchecked drafts, like
 * `ATTACH;X-SHA256=…:NomSystemdashboard/.claude/modules/drafts/IN2028_…/01_…/01_01_….md`.
 * The name of the file says what it is and its `X-CHAPTER`s what the session was about, so a document has no name
 * of my own; a file keeps the fingerprint of its content, the SHA-256 of its bytes, as parameter, so the link
 * survives a rename. An older `X-TOPIC` beside the path is no more read, and goes once the entry changes.
 * The folder of a chapter is no `ATTACH`: an older entry that links one names that chapter, which is still read,
 * see {@link chaptersOf}, and becomes its `X-CHAPTER` once the entry changes; its `DESCRIPTION` is only my free note.
 * The folder of a module in an `ATTACH` of an older entry counts no more and goes once the entry changes too.
 * The reader checks every link of the whole log when it starts and every night at 04:00, see {@link linksCheckStart}:
 * a module folder that is gone, like after a rename, is found again by the code of the entry's module,
 * see `moduleFolderOf` in `notes.ts`, and its `SUMMARY` names the folder found; a document whose path no longer leads
 * to a file, like after a rename or a move into another folder of the module, is looked for by its fingerprint
 * among the module's documents, and a chapter by the name of its folder in the module folder found or its drafts.
 * Each repair goes into the entry, every other line of the file as it is, and into the reader's console, with the old
 * and the new path. A link it cannot repair stays as written, like a document deleted or the folder of a project,
 * which has no code to find it by, and the skill view lists it, see {@link linksLostRead}.
 * Fingerprints are kept by path, size and time of change, so only new or changed files are read again.
 * The reader sends a file a skill entry links, read only, so the page opens it in the browser's own viewer,
 * see {@link linkedFileRead}; no other file of `NomWorkspace`.
 * By the folder of its skill a skill entry also finds its log and a skill box its plan, any other entry or box
 * the log or the plan of its year, see {@link calendarFileOf}.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Reads files and their sizes and times of change.
 * - `node:path`: Builds file paths for the operating system.
 * - `node:crypto`: Computes the SHA-256 of a file.
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Reads the log, finds an entry's event, puts new values into it or changes its fields,
 *   writes its start and the days in Berlin time, and names the category of skill entries.
 * - `./notes.ts`: Finds the folder of a module by its code and of a chapter by its name, lists the documents
 *   of a module, names a folder to read, and gives the content type of a file.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names `NomWorkspace`, the folders of my modules and of their drafts, the skills of the semester
 *   and the log of the skill area, and builds the paths of the files of plan and log of a year and of a skill.
