 * ## Files
 *
 * Lists the files of my new system for the tree of the editor, reads one and writes one back as I saved it.
 * The tree is `NomManageplannings` with every folder in it, also one I add later, but never my old system,
 * `NomSystemprevious`, at any depth, nor a hidden file or folder, like `.obsidian`, nor a symbolic link.
 * Reads and writes only inside the three folders of my new system, see `systemFiles` in `sources.ts`:
 * a Markdown file, like `NomMetainformations/Foods.md` or a daily note, to edit, written exactly as sent,
 * without a diff, since only my module drafts keep diffs, see `edit.ts`; an `.ics` file only to read.
 * Paths are written from `NomManageplannings` with `/`, like `NomManagecalendar/2026/2026_10/2026_10_Log.ics`.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Lists folders, reads and writes files.
 * - `node:path`: Builds file paths for the operating system.
 * - `./edit.ts`: Gives the form of a file as I saved it in the editor.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names the tree, the folder left out of it and the three folders, and tells which files
 *   the reader may write.
