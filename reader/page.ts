/**
 * Starts Vite inside the server of the reader, so page and data share one address.
 * - `root`: Folder of `index.html`, one up from this file.
 * - `publicDir`: Folder of the files given out as they are, like the logo `icon.svg`, named `assets` as in WokFlow.
 * - `middlewareMode`: Answers only the requests the reader hands over, without a server of its own.
 * - `hmr.server`: Sends its reload messages through the server of the reader.
 * - `allowedHosts`: Answers my devices too, which reach skriptum through Tailscale by a name ending in `.ts.net`,
 *   like `skriptum.tail1234.ts.net`; Vite refuses every other name but `localhost`.
 * - `watch.ignored`: Leaves out `.claude/`, where Claude sessions write files of their own:
 *   every new `.html` there reloaded every open page.
 * - `appType`: Answers unknown addresses with `index.html`, as for a single page.
 *
 * @param server - Server of the reader
 * @returns {@link ViteDevServer} whose `middlewares` answer the requests for the page
