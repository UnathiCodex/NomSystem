/**
 * ## Devices
 *
 * Writes what each of my devices shows of the page into `Devices.md`, so the dashboard is shaped for each of them:
 * one Markdown table, as `Places.md`, one row per device, its name in my tailnet, like `vuenvy`, its page
 * in CSS pixels, like `1920 × 1003`, its scale, like `2` for a 4K screen at 200 %, its screen in CSS pixels,
 * like `1920 × 1080`, whether it runs as the installed app, and since when its row holds these sizes, like
 * `13.10.2026 23:20`.
 * A device is what Tailscale names it: `tailscale serve` hands every request of my devices on to the reader with
 * the Tailscale address of its device in `X-Forwarded-For`, which `tailscale whois` names. A report with other sizes
 * writes the row of its device anew, the same sizes leave the file as it is, and a device without row yet gets one
 * at the end; the reader creates the file with the first report. A request without that address, which reached
 * the reader without Tailscale, like the browser of Claude's screenshots on skriptum, and one of skriptum itself
 * write nothing, since I never look at the dashboard on skriptum.
 *
 * - `node:child_process`: Asks Tailscale for the name of a device.
 * - `node:util`: Lets that be awaited.
 * - `node:os`: Gives the name of skriptum, which writes nothing.
 * - `node:fs`: Reads and writes `Devices.md`.
 * - `node:path`: Gives the folder of the file.
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Writes the day and the time of now in Berlin time.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names `Devices.md` and tells which files the reader may write.
