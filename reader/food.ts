/**
 * ## Food
 *
 * Reads my foods from `Foods.md`, finds foods by a name or a barcode, mine first, then on Open Food Facts,
 * page by page, adds new foods to `Foods.md` and renames them, keeps my meals in `Meals.md`, finds the grams I logged
 * each food with last, and reads the meals of a day from the log with what they give.
 * `Meals.md` holds my meals, each only its composition, one or more of my foods without grams, servings or variants,
 * since I prepare it a little differently every time: one Markdown table with one row per food of a meal, the meal,
 * the food, its brand and its store; an entry brings each food at the grams I logged it with last in an entry of its
 * category, see {@link gramsRead}, which I change there; the lists of my meals show each with what it gave the last
 * time I ate it, see {@link dishesRead}.
 * A meal keeps its name as I type it, its spaces too, like `Chili con Carne`, only without commas, see {@link mealNameOf}.
 * `Foods.md` is one Markdown table with one row per food: its name, kcal, protein, carbs and fat per 100 of its unit,
 * its portion, the amount I typically take at once, never empty, the Open Food Facts barcode it came from,
 * its brand and store, like `Milbona` and `Lidl`, so the same name of two shops never mixes up, the size of its
 * pack as sold, a bare number in its unit, like `265`, and last its kind, `Eat` or `Drink`, see {@link Kind}: a food
 * to eat counts per 100 g and in grams, a drink per 100 ml and in millilitres, like `Coca-Cola`; a product of Open Food
 * Facts goes in as Open Food Facts gives it, brand, store and pack empty where it knows none, a food added by hand
 * without barcode and pack, `Eat` until I change it, see {@link foodAdd}. No name, brand or
 * store of a food written holds a comma, which parts names, see {@link foodTextOf}.
 * A nutrient nobody gives is never 0: the one of protein, carbs and fat a food lacks is worked out from its kcal,
 * two or three missing stay unknown, an empty cell, which counts nothing, see {@link nutrientsOf}.
 * A row written before brand, store or pack were kept lacks them, and the table gets their columns with the next food.
 * A food renamed is renamed wherever it stands, see {@link foodChange}.
 * A meal is a log entry of the category `Food`: `SUMMARY` what I ate, its foods parted by `, `,
 * like `Reis, Bohnen, Eier`, drinks left out, `LOCATION` where, and one line `X-FOOD` per food: its name, brand and
 * store in `Foods.md`, then the grams I ate, the millilitres of a drink, a bare number either way, each part parted by
 * `;`, like `X-FOOD:Skyr natur;K-Classic;Kaufland;150` or `X-FOOD:Coca-Cola;Coca-Cola;Supermarkt;330`, so the log tells
 * which product it was, see {@link lineOf}; a line written before foods had brand and store names its food alone,
 * like `X-FOOD:Reis;150`, and a line without grams, like `X-FOOD:Skyr natur;K-Classic;Kaufland;` or `X-FOOD:Eier`,
 * counts nothing. A cooking, `Cook`, lists what went into the pot the same way, like
 * `X-FOOD:Hackfleisch;Gut & Günstig;Edeka;500`, which counts nothing.
 * Grams guessed, not weighed, like those Claude reads from a photo of a meal, carry `~`, like `X-FOOD:Döner;~400`,
 * and count as an estimate, since a guess from a photo is about a third off (Fridolfsson 2025).
 * A food of one of my meals carries the meal as a fifth part, like `X-FOOD:Hackfleisch;Gut & Günstig;Edeka;125;Chili con Carne`,
 * so the log keeps what the meal held that day, whatever I change in `Meals.md` later; its what names the meal,
 * then the foods eaten beside it, like `Chili con Carne, Weißbrot`; an older line of a meal carried its servings eaten
 * and its variant, like `Hackfleisch;62.5;Chili con Carne;0.5;09.10.2026`, still read.
 * A product of Open Food Facts is a pack as sold, its values per 100 g or 100 ml, with the size of the pack in grams
 * or millilitres, like `450` of `450 g`, its portion that of a serving where Open Food Facts gives one, else its pack,
 * else 100, see {@link productOf}.
 * Open Food Facts is asked anonymously: a request carries the search and the name of the dashboard,
 * never my email or my name.
