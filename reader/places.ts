/**
 * ## Places
 *
 * Reads and writes my places in `Places.md`, as `food.ts` does my foods in `Foods.md`: one Markdown table
 * with one row per place, `| Place | Street | Code | City | Country | Link |`, the fields of the dialog,
 * like `TUM Innenstadt` with `Arcisstraße 21`, `80333`, `München` and `Deutschland`, each part empty for none.
 * Every field of a place, the place of an entry and where a way starts, offers only these, see `categories.ts`,
 * and an entry writes its place as Google Calendar does, its name and its address in one line, see {@link lineOf},
 * like `TUM Innenstadt, Arcisstraße 21, 80333, München, Deutschland`, as its `LOCATION`, and where its way starts
 * as its `X-FROM`, so it keeps the address it had then, also once the address in `Places.md` changes;
 * its name is the part before the first comma, see {@link labelOf}, so a name never holds a comma: one typed
 * or read with a comma loses it, see {@link nameOf}. An older entry keeps the name alone, like `Home Munich`,
 * or its code and town in one part, like `TUM Innenstadt, Arcisstraße 21, 80333 München, Deutschland`,
 * see {@link lineIs}.
 * The last column, `Link`, may hold a link of a place, like `https://nav.tum.de/room/0509.EG.980`, which an entry
 * writes with it as the standard parameter `ALTREP` of its `LOCATION`, see {@link placeLinkOf}.
 * The file starts without places: I add each place with its address from the dialog of the day the first time
 * I need it, and the reader creates the file with that first place; the pencil below a place picked in the dialog
 * changes its row, its name, its address and its link, see {@link placeChange}, while every entry written before
 * keeps the line and the link it had.
 * Beside it `Rooms.md` holds the rooms of the university in one table of the same form, its first column `Room`,
 * like `0509.EG.980 (Audimax Werner-von-Siemens-Hörsaal)` with its address in its four parts
 * and `https://nav.tum.de/room/0509.EG.980`, read the same way, see {@link roomsRead}; an entry writes a room
 * as a place. A new place goes into `Rooms.md` when its name starts like the code of a room, digits and a dot,
 * see {@link roomForm}, otherwise into `Places.md`; a name is unique over both files.
 * Both tables stay sorted by name, see {@link rowsSort}.
 * A place is only where I physically am: what I do online, like a meeting on Zoom or a video on YouTube, an entry
 * writes apart from its place, see `Online` in `calendar.ts`, its platform one row of `Online.md`, see {@link Platform}.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Reads and writes `Places.md` and `Rooms.md`.
 * - `node:path`: Gives the folder of a file.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names `Places.md`, `Rooms.md`, `Online.md`, the plan and the log, and tells which files the reader
 *   may write.
