/**
 * ## Changes
 *
 * Tells every open page the moment a file of my new system changes, whoever changed it: the reader, like a food
 * renamed in every entry that holds it, a page of another device, or Syncthing bringing a change, so each page loads
 * anew what it shows, see `src/changes.ts`, and never shows, nor writes back, what the files held before.
 * A page asks `GET /api/changes` and keeps the answer open, a stream of server-sent events, one `data: changed`
 * per change; changes coming within a tenth of a second of each other, like the entries a rename writes one by one,
 * are told once, after the last. `Devices.md`, which a page writes when its size changes, see `devices.ts`,
 * tells nothing, since no page shows it.
 *
 * - `node:fs`: Watches the folders of the new system, every folder in them too.
 * - `node:path`: Builds the path of a file changed.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names the folders of the new system and `Devices.md`.
