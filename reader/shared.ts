/**
 * ## Shared
 *
 * Shares with Vu, whose dashboard runs on a server of its own, skriptum, what we agreed on and nothing else: an entry
 * of my log with Vu in `With`, and every food, meal and place either of us adds, changes or removes, so we both have
 * them. Who I share with, and how my server reaches theirs, names `sources.ts`, see `partners` there.
 * My reader sends what it shares at once, by SSH to the server of the other, `ssh nom-vu share <name>`, where the key
 * of my server may run nothing but the gate, see `gate.ts`, which puts it into my box in `NomKommunikation` of that
 * server, like `to_sopha/dashboard/`; the reader there sees it at once and takes it in, see {@link inboxTake},
 * and Vu's reader sends to mine the same way.
 *
 * What goes to Vu waits first as a file in Vu's box on my server, `NomKommunikation/to_vu/dashboard/`, named by the
 * moment, me and what it is, like `20261021T093000123Z_Sopha_entry_<UID>.ics` or `…_Sopha_list_<random>.json`,
 * and goes out in that order, each into my trash once Vu's server took it, see {@link outboxSend} and `trash.ts`;
 * there is no archive.
 * While Vu's server cannot be reached, it waits, and goes out with the next thing I share, as soon as Vu's reader starts
 * and says hello, see `hello` in `gate.ts`, or as soon as something comes from Vu.
 *
 * An entry: each of us in its `With` gets a copy as I add it or log a box, and one who comes into its `With`
 * as I change it, see {@link entryShare}: the same `UID`, its times, category, what, the link of what when it is a web address,
 * its place with the link of the place, where a way starts, the semester of a skill entry, the foods of a meal
 * or a cooking and the cooking a meal draws from, with me in `With` in place of the person, the others staying;
 * not my note, my attempts, my rounds, my chapters, the links to my files, my pain, what a session of sport did,
 * nor the box it was logged from, which are mine alone. After that each copy is its owner's: a change goes to nobody,
 * and a copy that comes for an entry the log of the other has already, by its `UID`, goes to their trash untaken,
 * so nothing remembers who had what, neither a file nor a line of the entry; an entry I took in goes to nobody
 * while its `With` stays, since its sender sent it to everyone in it.
 * A food, a meal or a place: what changed it, as the call of `food.ts` or `places.ts` that changed it, like `foodAdd`
 * with the food as written, see {@link ListChange}, which the reader of Vu makes on its own lists, see
 * {@link listApply}; one Vu has already, like the same food, a place of the same name or a meal already renamed,
 * stays as Vu has it. The first time my reader shares with someone, it sends all my foods, meals, places and rooms,
 * so our lists come together, see {@link sharedStart}. What I change in the editor by hand goes to nobody.
 *
 * What comes to me lands in my box, `NomKommunikation/to_sopha/dashboard/`: my reader takes it as it starts
 * and whenever the box changes, the earliest first, so a meal finds its foods and the cooking it draws from;
 * an entry into my log as the dialog would add it, see `entryAdd` in `day.ts`, with the `UID` it brought, so it comes
 * in only once; then the file goes into my trash. An entry my log cannot take, like one of a category
 * my reader does not know, stays in my box, and the reader says so once.
 *
 * - `node:child_process`: Runs `ssh` to the server of the other.
 * - `node:crypto`: Names a change of a list at random.
 * - `node:fs`: Creates the boxes, lists and watches mine, writes and reads what is shared.
 * - `node:path`: Builds the paths of the boxes.
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Reads the entries of my log and of a shared file, and writes the copy of an entry.
 * - `./day.ts`: Adds an entry that came to my log, as the dialog adds one.
 * - `./food.ts`: Reads, adds, changes and removes my foods and meals.
 * - `./places.ts`: Reads, adds and changes my places and rooms, and tells a link I typed, a web address.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names my log, my name, the people I share with and their boxes.
 * - `./trash.ts`: Puts what is done into my trash.
