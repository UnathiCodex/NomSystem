/**
 * ## Trackers
 *
 * Reads the trackers of a day from the log: my sleep against my goals, my glasses of water against my goal,
 * my neck sessions against my goal, and what my meals gave, see `food.ts`.
 * My goals stand here, in one place, and so do the numbers of my learning, see {@link settings}.
 * Sleep is an entry of the category `Sleep`, written by the entry by category with its start and end,
 * and its what, `Night` or `Day` for a nap, see `categories.ts`.
 * The night of a day is the longest sleep of at least 3 hours that ends on it in Berlin time, the sleep I wake up from
 * that morning, so a nap never becomes the night, and a sleep `Day` never, whatever its length; an old entry
 * without what counts like a `Night`. What I slept on a day is every sleep that ends on it, the night and the naps,
 * so a sleep from 22:00 to 05:00 counts for the day it ends on, never for the day it began on.
 * The week holds the nights of the day and the six days before it,
 * those logged: how long I slept on average, and how regular I was, how much my bedtime varied.
 * Glasses, meals and neck sessions count for the calendar day of their start in Berlin time, from 00:00 to 00:00,
 * like a glass of water at 01:00 on 14.10.2026 for 14.10.2026.
 * A glass of water is an entry of the category `Drink` with the what `Water`, which the counter of the day writes,
 * one per glass at the moment of the tap, five minutes long; such an entry from the entry by category counts too.
 * Every other drink, like `Kaffee`, counts as one glass as well, since the reference of 2.5 litres a day counts
 * the water of all drinks (EFSA 2010); the counter takes back only glasses of water.
 * A neck session is an entry of the category `Body` with a neck routine as its what, `Neck short` or `Neck long`,
 * see `categories.ts`; the trackers count the two parts of the routine apart over the day and the six days before it:
 * on how many of my study days I did one, short or long, since long holds short, and on how many days a long one.
 * A long session carries my neck pain from 0 to 10, its `X-PAIN`, the outcome the routine is judged by:
 * the mean of my first four weeks of pain against that of the last four, up to the day.
 * A study day is a day with an entry `Skill` in the log, like a lecture or a study session.
 *
 * - `./calendar.ts`: Reads the log and writes instants and their days in Berlin time.
 * - `./categories.ts`: Names the neck routines and the category of skill entries.
 * - `./food.ts`: Reads the meals of a day with what they give.
 * - `./sources.ts`: Names the log of the trackers.
